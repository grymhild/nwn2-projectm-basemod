You immediately jump to a nearby point and you become etheral for a single round. Where you were if you are in combat is replaced with a double. In addition your movement rate increases by 50% for one round per level. This spell can only be cast a few times in a row while in combat, due to the strain it puts on the caster which can vary based on the warlocks level.

Invocation Type: Lesser; Eldritch Essence
Spell Level Equivalent: 3

This eldritch essence invocation allows you to change your eldritch blast into a brimstone blast. A brimstone blast deals both fire and acid damage. Any creature struck by a brimstone blast must succeed on a Reflex save or catch on fire, taking 1d6 points of fire and 1d6 points of acid damage per round until the duration expires. The fire damage persists for 1 round per five class levels you have. A creature burning in this way never takes more than 2d6 points of acid and fire damage in a round, even if it has been hit by more than one brimstone blast.

Invocation Type: Least
Spell Level Equivalent: 2

You can create an area of deepest shadow at range in a 20-foot radius. All creatures in the area gain concealment (20% miss chance). Even creatures that can normally see in such conditions (such as with darkvision or low-light vision) have the miss chance in an area shrouded in magical darkness. Normal lights (torches, candles, lanterns, and so forth) are incapable of brightening the area. This invocation functions like the darkness spell, including countering or dispelling any light spell of equal or lower level. The darkness created by this invocation lasts for 6 seconds per caster level.

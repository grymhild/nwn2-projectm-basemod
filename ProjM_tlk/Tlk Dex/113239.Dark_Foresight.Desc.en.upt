However, once you've taken 10 points of melee damage per caster level, the effect ends immediately. The amount of reduction is based on warlock level with 10/alchemical silver, to level 14, 15/alchemical silver at level 15, 20/alchemical silver at level 20, 25/alchemical silver at level 25 and 30/alchemical silver at level 30.

Type of Feat: Class
Prerequisite: Sacred Fist level 4.
Specifics: At 4th level, a sacred fist may invoke sacred flames around his hands and feet. These flames add to the sacred fist's unarmed damage. The additional damage is equal to half sacred fist's class level plus half his Wisdom modifier (if any). This damage is not subject to effects that reduce fire damage, and it acts like both fire and divine damage. The sacred flames last 1 minute and can be invoked once per day. At 8th level, a sacred fist can invoke sacred flames twice per day.
Use: Selected.

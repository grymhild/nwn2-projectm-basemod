A warmage is specialized in dealing damage with his spells.  Whenever a warmage casts a spell that deals hit point damage, he adds his Intelligence bonus(if any) to the amount of damage dealt.

A single spell can never gain this extra damage more than once per casting.  If a spell deals damage for more than 1 round, it deals this extra damage in each round.

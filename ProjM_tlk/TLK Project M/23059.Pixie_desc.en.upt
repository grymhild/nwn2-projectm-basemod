Pixies are sneaky and mischievous creatures that are fond of adventure, but they prefer to disappear when directly endangered. These good-natured fey resemble tiny elves with long, gossamer wings. Being small and highly intelligent, they often make very good scouts or thieves.
Pixies are also capable of limited sorcery, favoring illusions and enchantments.

Type of Feat: Class
Specifics: When a 10th-level bladesinger makes a full attack with a longsword or rapier in one hand (and nothing in the other), she can make one extra attack in a round at her highest base attack bonus, but this attack and each other attack made in that round take a -2 penalty.
Use: Automatic.

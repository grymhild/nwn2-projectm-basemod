Type of Feat: Heritage
Prerequisite: Fey Heritage. Nonlawful Alignment
Specifics: Your fey heritage augments the power of certain types of magic. Your caster level and save DCs for enchantment spells and warlock invocations increase by 1. For warlocks this caster level increase may increase their eldritch blast damage (if their new caster level would gain an increase in blast dice, such as a level 2 with this feat) and their caster level can exceed their hit dice.
Use: Automatic.

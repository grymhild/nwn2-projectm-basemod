Type of Feat: Class
Specifics: You make a single melee touch attack which each weapon you wield. If an attack hits, the enemy takes 1d8 points of Dexterity damage for 1 minute. A successful Fortitude save (DC 17 + your Strength modifier) halves the Dexterity damage. This ability damage does not stack.
Use: Selected.

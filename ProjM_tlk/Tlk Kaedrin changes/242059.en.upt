Type of Feat: Class
Specifics: As the verdant lord gains levels, he begins to manifest amazing abilities and qualities possessed by many plantlike creatures. At 13th level, a verdant lord's natural armor increases by +3 as his skin grows thick and bark-like. This natural armor bonus stacks with the natural armor bonus granted by the Forest Lord prestige class but not with any other source of natural armor class. This bonus improves to +6 at 16th level and +9 at 19th level.
Use: Automatic.

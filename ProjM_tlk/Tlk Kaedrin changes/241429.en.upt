Once per day, you can enter a feral battle trance. While you are in this state, the raw power of the beast flows through you. For the duration of the trance, you gain a +4 bonus to Dexterity and a +2 bonus on attack rolls. A feral trance lasts for a number of rounds equal to 3 + your Con modifier. At 3rd level, you can use this ability twice per day. The Extend Rage feat increases the duration by 5 rounds. This is an instantly activated feat.

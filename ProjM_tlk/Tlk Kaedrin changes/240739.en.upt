Type of Feat: Class
Specifics: Upon reaching 7th level, the forest master's body becomes a thing of wood and leaf rather than meat and bone. His type changes to plant. As such, he is immune to mind-affecting effects, poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning, and hostile polymorphing. He is no longer subject to critical hits or sneak attacks. However, the forest master becomes vulnerable to fire, and suffers double damage from fire attacks if he fails a Reflex saving throw, or half damage if he succeeds.
Use: Automatic.

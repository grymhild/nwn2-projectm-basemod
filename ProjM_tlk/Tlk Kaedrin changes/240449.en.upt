Type of Feat: Class
The stormsinger can use her bardic music ability to create various storm-related effects in addition to the normal uses of bardic music.
At 10th level, a stormsinger with 18 or more ranks in Perform can use bardic music to cause a storm of vengeance, as the spell of the same name (DC 10 + stormsinger's class level + Cha modifier). Her caster level is equal to her ranks in Perform, with a maximum caster level of 35th. This potent ability is quite exhausting to use; each time it is activated, the stormsinger uses four of her bardic music uses for the day.
Use: Selected.

You create tiny darts of force.
Prerequisite: Ability to cast 3rd-level spells.
Benefit: As long as you have a force spell of 3rd level or higher available to cast, you can use a standard action to hurl a tiny needle-shaped projectile created from pure force. This attack requires a successful ranged attack roll, and the dart has a range of 5 feet per level of the force spell. The needle deals 1d4 points of damage per level of the highest-level force spell you have available.

This spell gains damage from Sneak Attack and Death Attack when appropriate.

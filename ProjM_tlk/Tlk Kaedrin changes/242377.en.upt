Type of Feat: Class
Specifics: Once per day, a hexblade of 12th level or higher can create a baleful aura of misfortune. Any melee or ranged attack made against the hexblade while this aura of unluck is active has a 20% miss chance (similar to the effect of concealment). The aura lasts for a number of rounds equal to 4 + the hexblade's Charisma bonus (if any).

At 16th level and every four levels after that (20th, 24th, and 28th) the hexblade gains an additional use of the aura.
Use: Selected

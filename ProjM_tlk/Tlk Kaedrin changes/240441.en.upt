Type of Feat: Class
The stormsinger can use her bardic music ability to create various storm-related effects in addition to the normal uses of bardic music.
At 3rd level, a stormsinger with 11 or more ranks in Perform can use bardic music to unleash a deadly thunderbolt. The bolt can be targeted at any one creature within 60 feet, and the stormsinger must make a successful ranged touch attack to hit the target. If she hits, the stormsinger then makes a Perform check; the result indicates how much electricity damage the thunderbolt deals (double on a critical hit). A perform check is d20 + your Perform skill (including all bonuses to Perform). A Reflex save (DC10 + stormsinger's class level + Cha modifier) halves the damage. If the creature fails its Reflex save, it must make a Fortitude save (same DC) or be deafened for a number of rounds equal to the damage dealt.
Use: Selected.

When this spell is cast, you drink in the life force of all enemies in the area of effect. Creatures who succeed at a Fortitude save (DC +5) lose only half their remaining hit points, while those who fail their saving throw lose all their remaining hit points and are instantly slain. The total amount of damage done by this spell is then added to the caster's hit point total. Moreover, the life-force of slain creatures coalesces as a Greater Shadow, which will attack any surviving enemies.

You are only able to absorb sufficient hit points to return you to full health. Any remaining life force dissipates into the fabric of the Weave.
 
Use: Selected.

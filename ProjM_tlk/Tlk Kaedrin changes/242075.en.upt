Invocation Type: Greater
Spell Level Equivalent: 5

You conjure a curtain of fire that deals 2d6 points plus the warlock's caster level (max +20) of fire and magic damage to any creature that attempts to pass through it. Half the wall's fire damage results from supernatural power and is therefore not subject to being reduced by resistance to fire. Undead within the wall take double damage. The curtain of flame lasts for 1 round per warlock level before dissipating.

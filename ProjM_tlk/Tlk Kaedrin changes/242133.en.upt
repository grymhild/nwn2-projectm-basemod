Type of Feat: Class
Specifics: At each level except 2nd, you gain new spells per day and an increase in caster level (and spells known, if applicable) as if you had also gained a level in a divine based spellcasting class to which you belonged before adding the prestige class level. You do not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained. If you had more than one divine spellcasting class before becoming a daggerspell shaper, you must decide which class to progress in.
Use: Automatic.

Type of Feat: General
Prerequisite: Barbarian damage reduction 1/- (or better) OR Unbroken Flesh (Anointed Knight 5) OR Scarred Flesh (Warrior of Darkness 5) or Dragonslayer damage reduction 1/- (or better)
Specifics: Your damage reduction increases by 1. If it would normally rise thereafter with level, it does so at its previous rate, adding the +1 normally. For example, a 13th-level barbarian has damage reduction 3/-. By taking this feat, he raises it to 4/-. When he reaches 16th level, his damage reduction becomes 5/- and at 19th level, it becomes 6/-.
Use: Automatic.

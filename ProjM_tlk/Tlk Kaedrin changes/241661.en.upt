Specifics: At 10th level, a blightlord's infected blood effects a terrible change in her physiology. Her skin blackens and splits, becoming cold and slimy to the touch, although she does not bleed or suffer pain from this transformation. She is no longer subject to poison, sleep, mind-affecting effects, paralysis, critical hits, or sneak attacks.
Use: Automatic.

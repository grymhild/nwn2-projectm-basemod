Type of Feat: Class
Specifics: At 6th level and higher, a ninja can spend one daily use of her <i>ki</i> power to cause an attack against her to miss when it might otherwise hit. When a ninja activates this ability, her outline shifts and wavers, granting her concealment (20% miss chance) against all attacks for 3 rounds. This is an instantly activated ability.  Starting at 18th level, a ninja's <i>ki</i> dodge ability grants total concealment (50% miss chance).
Use: Selected.

Type of Feat: Class
A master of radiance can emanate an aura of brilliant light that weakens undead creatures. The aura provides bright illumination in a 30-foot radius around the character, and shadowy illumination for an additional 30 feet beyond that. Undead creatures (and those sensitive to light) take a -2 penalty on attack rolls, armor class, and saving throws. Each use lasts 1 minute. It also dispells any darkness spell of 5th level or lower in the area.
Use: Selected.
A master of radiance has 1 use/day at 1st level, 2 uses/day at 3rd level, and 3 uses/day at 5th level.

Type of Feat: Class
Prerequisite: Forest Master level 1.
Specifics: At levels 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, and 10 you gain new spells per day and an increase in caster level (and spells known) as if you had also gained a level in a divine spellcasting class to which you belonged before adding the prestige class level. If you had more than one divine spellcasting class before becoming a forest master, you must decide which class gains the increased casting ability.
Use: Automatic.

Type of Feat: General
Prerequisite: Barbarian's Rage ability.
Specifics: After passing several initiation rites, you became an honorary member of the Ice Troll Berserker Lodge. Their warriors have trained you in their unique fighting style, providing new insight into the untapped potential of your inner fury. While raging, your character now gets a bonus +2 natural armor bonus to AC. This bonus increases to +4 if the player has Greater Rage, +6 with Mighty Rage, and +8 with Epic Rage. This natural AC does not stack with other sources of natural AC.
Use: Automatic.

This spell attempts to strip all magical effects from a single target, or remove the strongest magical effect from a group of targets. To dispel an effect, you make a caster level check (1d20 + your caster level, maximum of +20) against a DC of (11 + the caster level of the targeted spell's caster). You make a caster level check against each effect on the target. If any spells are successfully removed, you gain twice your warlock level in temporary hit points (which add to your maximum hit points). These temporary hit points fade after 1 minute

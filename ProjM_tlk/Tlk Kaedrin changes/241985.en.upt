Type of Feat: Skill
Prerequisite: Intimidate as a class skill.
Specifics: You can use Intimidate to weaken an opponent's resolve in combat. To do so, make an Intimidate check opposed by the target's modified level check (d20 + hit dice + Wisdom bonus). If you succeed, the target becomes shaken for 1 round. This is an instantly activated ability with a 6 second cooldown. A shaken character takes a -2 penalty on attack rolls, skills, and saving throws.
Use: Selected.

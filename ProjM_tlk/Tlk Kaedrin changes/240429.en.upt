Type of Feat: Class
Prerequisite: Bladesinger level 1.
Specifics: On every odd level, the Bladesinger progresses in one selected arcane spellcasting class. If a character had more than one spellcasting class in which he could cast arcane spells before he became a Bladesinger, the player must decide which class to assign each level of Bladesinger for the purpose of determining spells per day and spells known.
Use: Automatic.

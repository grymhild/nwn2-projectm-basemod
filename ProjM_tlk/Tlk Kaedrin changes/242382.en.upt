Type of Feat: Class
Prerequisite: Harper agent
Specifics: When a Harper agent gains a level, he gains new spells per day  (and spells known, if applicable) as if he had also gained a level in a spellcasting class he belonged to before adding the prestige class. He does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (hit points, bonus feats, etc.), except for an increased level of effective spellcasting level. This spellcasting class is chosen from any spellcasting classes you have when you first become a Harper agent, and all Harper agent levels only improve spells per day progression in that one class.
Use: Automatic.

Enrage animal bestows the effects of the whirlwind frenzy rage: a +4 bonus to Strength and a +2 dodge bonus to Armor Class and on Reflex saves. While in a whirling frenzy, the animal companion may make one extra attack in a round at its highest base attack bonus, but this attack takes a -2 penalty, as does each other attack made that round.

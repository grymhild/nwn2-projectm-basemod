Type of Feat: Class
Prerequisite: Frostmage level 1.
Specifics: At every level you gain new spells per day and an increase in caster level (and spells known) as if you had also gained a level in an arcane or divine spellcasting class to which you belonged before adding the prestige class level. If you had more than one spellcasting class before becoming a frostmage, you must decide which class gains the increased casting ability.
Use: Automatic.

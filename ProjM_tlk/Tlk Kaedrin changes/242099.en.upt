You combine your scout training with the stealth of a rogue or ninja to open up new methods of ambushing enemies.
Type: General
Prerequisite: Scout Level 3, Sneak Attack +1d6
Benefit: Your ninja, rogue, and scout levels stack for the purpose of determining your Swashbuckler Dodge bonus. In addition, your scout levels are treated as rogue levels for the purpose of determining your total number of sneak dice (ie, the progression is faster).

For example, a 4th-level scout/7th-level rogue would have a +3 Swashbuckler Dodge AC bonus (as a level 11 scout) and a +6d6 Sneak Attack (as a level 11 rogue).

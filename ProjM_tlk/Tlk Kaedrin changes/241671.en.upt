Type of Feat: Class
Specifics: Beginning at 3rd level, a ghost-faced killer can panic onlookers and even frighten his victim to death by making a sudden strike attack. The ghost-faced killer makes a single melee attack and the victim must make a Will save (DC 10 + ghost-faced killer's class level + Cha modifier). 

If the victim succeeds, she is shaken for 1 round per class level; if she fails, she dies instantly of fear. Creatures immune to mind-affecting effects, immune to fear, or with hit dice that exceed the ghost-faced killer's character level are immune to this frightful attack.

In additional, all creatures within 30 feet who see the frightful attack become shaken for 1 round per class level. A successful Will save (DC 10 + ghost-faced killer's class level + Cha modifier) negates this effect.
Use: Selected.

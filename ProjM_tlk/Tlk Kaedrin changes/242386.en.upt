This spell attempts to strip all magical effects from a single target. To dispel an effect, you make a caster level check (1d20 + your caster level, maximum +10) against a DC of (11 + the caster level of the targeted spell's caster). You make a caster level check for each effect on the target. If any spells on the target are dispelled, the target takes half your caster level in magic damage.

Invocation Type: Least; Blast Shape
Spell Level Equivalent: 2

Your eldritch blast takes on physical substance, appearing similar to a glaive. As a full-round action, you can make a single melee touch attack. If you hit, your target is affected as if struck by your eldritch blast (including any eldritch essence applied to the blast).

If your base attack bonus is +6 or higher, you can (as part of the full-round action) make as many attacks with your <i>eldritch glaive</i> as your base attack bonus allows (maximum of 4). You currently need a full 5 BAB to get each attack. For example, a 14th-level warlock could attack twice, once with a base attack bonus of +10, and again with a base attack bonus of +5.

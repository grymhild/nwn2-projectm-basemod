Type of Feat: Reserve
You control darkness and shadows.
Prerequisite: Ability to cast 3rd-level spells.
Benefit: As long as you have a darkness spell of 3rd level or higher available to cast, shadows and darkness appear to obey your will. As a standard action, you can direct these shadows to obscure the vision of one foe within 30 feet. If your target fails a Will save, its attacks have a miss chance equal to 5% per level of the highest-level darkness spell you have available to cast. This effect lasts until the beginning on your next action.

Creatures that do not rely on sight are unaffected by this effect, and those with Blind-fight or similar abilities can fight as they normally would.

Trigger Spells: Mass Blindness and Deafness, Shadow Conjuration, Shadow Shield

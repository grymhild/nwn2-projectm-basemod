Invocation Type: Dark; 
Spell Level Equivalent: 7

You imbue a single creature within 30 feet with vulnerability to a particular type of energy (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic). A successful Fortitude save negates the effect. 

The vulnerability lasts for 24 hours or until you use the invocation on the creature a second time, in which case the first effect ends and the new vulnerability and duration take effect.

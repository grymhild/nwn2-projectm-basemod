Type of Feat: Class
Specifics: Beginning at 2nd level, a forest master begins to awaken magical abilities within the wood and metal that make up his warmace. Any warmace used by a forest master is treated as if it were a +2 weapon with either the frost or shock property (the forest master can change which of these elements infuse the weapon at will).

Beginning at 6th-level, the forest master's warmace acts as a +2 icy burst or shocking burst weapon (as the forest master's chooses).

At 9th level, the forest master's warmace acts as a +3 mighty cleaving weapon in addition to the elemental properties.
Use: Automatic.

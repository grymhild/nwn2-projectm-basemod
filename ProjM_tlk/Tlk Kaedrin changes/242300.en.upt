Type of Feat: Epic
Prerequisites: 21st level, Evasion, Epic Prowess.
Specifics: As a full attack action, the character makes a single normal attack against an opponent (regardless of the number of attacks per round they normally receive). If the attack hits, the target's weakness is exposed: every round for 5 rounds the target takes damage equal to the character's Dex bonus (minimum of 1). This damage ignores all damage reductions and immunities.  During this time, the target's AC is also reduced by 3.  This ability has a cooldown of 6 seconds. This ability does NOT work with ranged or thrown weapons.
Use: Selected.

You can use greater invisibility, as the spell, but only on yourself. The effect lasts for 1 round per warlock level. If your retributive invisibility is dispelled, a shock wave releases from your body in a 20-foot-radius burst. This shock wave deals 4d6 points of sonic damage to all creatures in the area and stuns them for 1 round (a Fortitude save halves the damage and negates the stunning effect). Greater invisibility provides 50% concealment for the duration of the spell (including after the invisibility breaks) and provides invisibility until you attack.

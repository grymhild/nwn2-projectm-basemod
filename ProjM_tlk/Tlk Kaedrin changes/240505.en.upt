Type of Feat: Class
Prerequisite: Swiftblade level 1.
Specifics: At levels 2,3,5,6,8, and 9 you gain new spells per day and an increase in caster level (and spells known) as if you had also gained a level in an arcane spellcasting class to which you belonged before adding the prestige class level. If you had more than one arcane spellcasting class before becoming a swiftblade, you must decide which class gains the increased casting ability.
Use: Automatic.

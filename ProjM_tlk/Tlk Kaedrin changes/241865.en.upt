Type of Feat: Class
Specifics: Starting at 3rd level, a dread pirate can inspire his allies (including himself) to great bravery in combat once per day. This inspiration grants them a +1 bonus on saving throws against charm and fear effects, a +1 attack bonus, and a +1 bonus on weapon damage rolls. This is an instantly activated ability and lasts for 1 minute per class level. At 7th level, a dread pirate can use this ability twice per day, and the bonus increases to +2. Rally the Crew can not be used while Inspire Courage is active.

If a dread pirate has the inspire courage bardic music ability, he adds this bonus automatically whenever he uses the inspire courage ability. For example, an 8th-level bard/3rd-level dread pirate would provide a +3 bonus on attack rolls and weapon damage rolls. 
Use: Selected.

At 5th level, the shining blade can cause a melee weapon he is holding to become a holy weapon, dealing an extra 2d6 points of divine damage against evil on a successful hit.  The weapon is enchanced this way for up to a number of rounds equal to the shining blade's level plus his Charisma modifier (if any).  In a given combat a shining blade can spend one standard action to make his weapon holy and another to make it a shock weapon with Shocking Blade.

At 9th level the Shocking Blade and Holy Blade abilities will also grant a +2 attack bonus. If both abilities are used on the same weapon the bonus will stack.

Type of Feat: General
Prerequisite: Telthor Companion or Devoted Tracker, Natural Bond.
Specifics: The character's level for determining their animal or telthor companion increases by 6, up to the character's total level. This bonus replaces the benefit gained by Natural Bond and stacks with Devoted Tracker and Epic Animal Companion. For example, a 10th level spirit shaman/8th level paladin would now have an telthor companion as if they were an 13th level druid (17th if they had Devoted Tracker).
Use: Automatic.

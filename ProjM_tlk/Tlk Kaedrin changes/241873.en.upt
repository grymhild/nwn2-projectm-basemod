Type: General
Prerequisite: Paladin level 5, Tracking, and Animal Companion or Telthor Companion.
Benefit: Your Paladin levels count for the purpose of determining your animal companion's level (at Paladin level - 4). Your companion also gains Dash, Improved Evasion, and a +2 dodge AC bonus. If you have 15 levels or more of Paladin then your companion gains Spell Resistance equal to 5 + it's hit dice.  Your effective Druid companion level is equal to any druid levels plus Ranger - 3, Paladin - 4, and any Lion of Talisid levels. It can be further modified with the Natural Bond and Epic Animal Companion feats. This feat will also work for the Telthor Companion feat (stacking full Spirit Shaman levels and Paladin - 4 levels).

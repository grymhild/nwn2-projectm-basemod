Type of Feat: Class
Specifics: Avengers and Black Flame Zealots can study their enemies and strike a deadly blow.  With a melee touch attack, the player rolls d6 per effective level (double on a critical) and slays the target if their HP is less than this value. The effective level is the total of all Avenger, Assassin, and Black Flame Zealot levels. This ability will only succeed if the target is not immune to sneak attacks and a sneak attack would be valid when the touch is made. This ability takes two rounds to cast.
Use: Automatic.

This exotic heavy armor consists of reinforced metal plates, a layer of padding worn under the armor, and a suit of light chain worn between the two. The armor includes gauntlets, metal-shod boots, a heavy helm, and carefully wrought joint guards. As with full plate, buckles and straps distribute the weight over the wearer's body.

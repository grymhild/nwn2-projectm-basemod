Type of Feat: Class
Prerequisite: Pale Master.
Specifics: Beginning at 2nd level and at each new level, the pale master gains new spells per day as if he had also gained a level in an arcane spellcasting class he belonged to before adding the prestige class. He does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (hit points, bonus feats, etc.), except for an increased level of effective spellcasting level. This spellcasting class is chosen from any arcane spellcasting classes that give you access to 3rd-level spells when you first become a pale master, and all pale master levels only improve spells per day progression in that one class.
Use: Automatic.

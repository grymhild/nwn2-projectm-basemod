Type of Feat: Class
The stormsinger can use her bardic music ability to create various storm-related effects in addition to the normal uses of bardic music.
At 9th level, a stormsinger with 17 or more ranks in Perform can use bardic music to unleash a terrible stroke of lightning, bollowed by a deafening clap of thunder. The great thunderstrike affects a line 60 feet long from the stormsinger. The stormsinger makes a Perform check; the results indicate how much electricity damage the great thunderstrike deals (double on a critical). A Reflex save (DC10 + stormsinger's class level + Cha modifier) halves the damage. If the creature fails its Reflex save, it must make a Fortitude save (same DC) or take an additional 2d6 points of sonic damage and be permanently deafened.

The great thunderstrike is very strenuous, and uses up two of the stormsinger's bardic music uses for the day.
Use: Selected.

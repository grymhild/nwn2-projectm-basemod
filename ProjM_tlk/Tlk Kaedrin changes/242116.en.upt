Type of Feat: Class
Specifics: As a daggerspell mage advances in level, the connection between his spellcasting abilities and his two-dagger fighting style strengthens. At 5th level or higher, a daggerspell mage delivers melee touch attack spells with both of his daggers (adding the base dagger damage plus any enhance bonus from each dagger).
Use: Automatic.

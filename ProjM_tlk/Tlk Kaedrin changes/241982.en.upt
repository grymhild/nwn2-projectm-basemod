Type of Feat: General
Prerequisite: Grace +1, Fearsome Reputation +2.
Benefit: Your dread pirate and swashbuckler levels stack for the purpose of determining your competence bonus on Reflex saves from the grace class feature and the swashbuckler's dodge bonus to AC. For example, a 7th-level dread pirate/4th-level swashbuckler has grace +2 and gains a +2 dodge bonus to AC, as if she were an 11th-level swashbuckler.

Your dread pirate and swashbuckler levels also stack for the purpose of determining your dread pirate level for Fearsome Reputation. For example, a 7th-level dread pirate/4th-level swashbuckler would have Fearsome Reputation +6 as if she were an 10th-level dread pirate.

<i>You combine grace and brashness to deadly effect.<i>

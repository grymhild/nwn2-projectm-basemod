Type of Feat: Class
Prerequisite: Dragon Shaman level 4.
Specifics: At 4th level, you gain a breath weapon corresponding to your totem dragon. All breath weapons deal 2d6 points of damage, plus an extra 1d6 points of damage for every two addtional class levels (3d6 at 6th level, 4d6 at 8th level, and so forth). A successful Reflex save halves the damage dealth; the save DC is equal to 10 + 1/2 your Dragon Shaman level + your Con modifier. This ability has a 15 second cooldown before it can be used again.

The breath weapon is a cone shaped blast of energy dependent on your dragon choice (see below) that initially extends out to 15 feet. This increases to 30 feet at 12th level and 60 feet at 20th level. Black, Green, and Copper dragon shamans deal Acid damage. Blue and Bronze dragon shamans deal Lightning damage. White and Silver dragon shamans deal Cold damage. Red, Brass, and Gold dragon shamans deal Fire damage.

Type of Feat: Bardic Music
You have mastered the snowflake wardance, a mystical style of fighting with slashing weapons that allows you to leap and almost seem to float haphazardly across the battlefield like a whirling, razor-edged snowflake.
Prerequisite: Bardic Music, Perform 6.
Benefit: By expending one of your daily uses of bardic music, you may perform a deadly style of combat known as the snowflake wardance. Once activated, you add your Charisma modifier to your attack rolls with any slashing melee weapon you are wielding in one hand. This bonus to hit stacks with any bonuses you get from a high Strength score (or Dexterity score, if you are using Weapon Finesse).
You cannot use this feat if you are carrying a shield, wearing medium or heavy armor, or carrying a medium or heavy load. If dual wielding, both weapons must be slashing. This does not work with two-handed weapons.
A snowflake wardance lasts for a number of rounds equal to 1 + your ranks in Perform. Performing a snowflake wardance is physically tiresome - when the dance ends, you become fatigued for the next 10 minutes. Fatigue causes a -2 penalty to Strength and Dexterity as well as a 10% movement speed reduction. It can only be removed by resting and the bardic song <i>Epic of the Lost King</i>
Use: Selected.

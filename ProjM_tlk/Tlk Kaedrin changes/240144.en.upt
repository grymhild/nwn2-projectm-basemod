Twice per day as a swift action, a shining blade can cause a melee weapon he is holding to become a shock weapon, dealing an extra 1d6 points of electricity damage on a successful hit.  The weapon is enchanced this way for up to a number of rounds equal to the shining blade's level plus his Charisma modifier (if any), but only so long as the shining blade is holding the weapon. This increases to 3 times/day at 3rd level, 4 times/day at 5th, 5 times/day at 7th, and 6 times/day at 9th.

At 9th level the Shocking Blade and Holy Blade abilities will also grant a +2 attack bonus. If both abilities are used on the same weapon the bonus will stack.

Type of Feat: Reserve
You wreak havoc with the inner organs of a target, causing it to grow ill.
Prerequisite: Ability to cast 3rd-level spells.
Benefit: As long as you have a necromancy spell of 3rd level or higher available to cast, you can make a melee touch attack against living creatures which becomes sickened for a number of rounds equal to the level of the highest-level necromancy spell you have available. The subject can reduce this duration to 1 round with a successful Fortitude save.

A sickened creature takes a -2 penalty on attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, saving throws, and skill checks.

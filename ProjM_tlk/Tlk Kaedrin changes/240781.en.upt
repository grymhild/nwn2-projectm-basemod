Specifics:  A barbarian with this variant form of rage doesn't gain the normal bonuses when he enters a rage. Instead, when a barbarian with whirling frenzy enters a rage, he temporarily gains a +4 bonus to Strength and a +2 dodge bonus to Armor Class and on Reflex saves. While in a whirling frenzy, the barbarian may make one extra attack in a round at his highest base attack bonus, but this attack takes a -2 penalty, as does each other attack made that round. This extra attack does not stack with Haste and uses the haste improvement instead (no penalty applied to all attacks).

Whirling frenzy is otherwise identical to the standard barbarian rage in all other ways. At 11th level (when a standard barbarian gains greater rage), the Strength bonus increases to +6, and the dodge bonus to Armor Class and on Reflex saves increases to +3. At 20th level (when a standard barbarian gains mighty rage), the Strength bonus increases to +8, and the dodge bonus to Armor Class and on Reflex saves increases to +4. This bonus increases to +10 Strength and +5 AC/Reflex saves with the Epic Rage feat.

A barbarian using this variant doesn't gain indomitable will at 14th level. Instead, he gains evasion, but only while in a whirling frenzy. 

Use: Selected. The barbarian may use this ability once per day at first level, +1 use per day at level 4, and every 4 levels thereafter.  The feat has a cooldown timer that lasts as long as the length of the rage and fatigue (if any).

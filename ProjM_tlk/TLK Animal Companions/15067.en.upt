Psionic Myconids, or fungus men, are a race of intelligent fungi that live in remote reaches of the Underdark. They are cautious creatures that deplore violence. Myconids resemble humanoid toadstools. Small myconids stand 3 feet tall, Medium-sized myconids about 7 feet tall, and Large myconids about 10 feet tall. Their flesh is bloated and spongy and varies in color from purple to gray. Their wide feet have vestigial toes and their pudgy hands have two stubby fingers and a thumb on either side.

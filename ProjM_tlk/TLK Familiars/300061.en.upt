This Lantern Archon is a weaker version than normally found in the celestial heavens.  It only has two possible roles as it lacks any damaging attacks.  Its primary role is as a messenger as it can communicate telepathically, and its secondary role is to act as a channel for spells for its Sylph mistress.

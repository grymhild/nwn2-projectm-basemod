Jet black surrounded by fire, this horse shaped outsitder is evil incarnate.  They willingly bond with evil wizards who are prepared to spread evil and misery in the world.  Compared to horses, Nightmares are reasonably intelligent.  They have good tracking skills and tend to gain the initiative in combat.  Their bite and kicks deal fire damage, and they are immune to fire.

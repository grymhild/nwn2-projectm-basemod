The bone spider is a reanimated giant spider.  In addition to the benefits of being undead (immunity to sneak attack etc) they retain their poisonous bite that they possessed in life.  Not very strong in combat, their posionous bite can turn the tide of battle draining health upon biting and the victim suffers further strength damage later.  This ability damage increases as the Spider increases in strength and can become very deadly.  Their skin is extreemly resistant to damage at higher levels from both slashing and piercing weapons.

Pseudodragons resemble miniature red dragons, but in looks alone. They do not commit evil acts; in fact they dislike evil acts very much. They do gain the power of fire like their large cousins starting at the master's 5th level.

Pseudodragons resemble miniature red dragons, but are red-brown in color rather than deep-red. They have fine scales, sharp horns and teeth and a barbed tail.  The tail is their primary attack which contains a poison capable of putting its targets to sleep.  This poison is full strength from the moment the Pseudodragon is born and very strong against lower level creatures.  However, against higher level creaters it is less effective. 

Their cat-like personality makes them seem arrogant and demanding. They are often found in the company of arrogant and demanding wizards.

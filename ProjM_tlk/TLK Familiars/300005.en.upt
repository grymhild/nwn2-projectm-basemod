Ice mephits can create cones of cold.

Pulled from the elemental planes, mephits are cunning and swift opponents. These small creatures can be quite hard to kill and also quite deadly. While they are normally found on the para-Elemental plane of Ice or the colder regions of the planes of Air or Water they are actually creatures of the outer planes and can be found in those areas of the outer planes where cold is dominant.

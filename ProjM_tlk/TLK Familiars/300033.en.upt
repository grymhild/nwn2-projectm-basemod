<Color=Green>Sometimes a mage does not want to make a bond with a living creature and would rather have a more controllable familiar, one they can be sure will do as instructed.  Most constructs have limited intelligence and only will respond to a direct command or specific instructions (eg: defend this place from intruders... excluding me of course!)  However, there are some constructs which are designed with more intelligence.  Overall constructs are generally quite robust creatures and the larger vairants are good at protecting their master.  They can be affected by spells or abilities that target constructs<Color=White>

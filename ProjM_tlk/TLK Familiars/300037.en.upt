<Color=Green>The 'pure' dragons generally speaking would never condecend to become the familiar of a mere mortal.  However, the 'lesser' draconic races are quite often willing in return for a steady supply of food and a soft quite place to sleep, and if its not too much trouble, a small pile of gold and assorted treasure to keep.  Being Dragons they are vulnerable to all effects that affect dragons.

As a note on Familiars vs Animal Companions, young dragons do sometimes become the companions of Druids and afford their Druid partner with a modicum of respect.  However, with dragon familiars it is sometimes difficult to tell who is the master and who is the familiar, sometimes to the point when meeting a stranger, the dragon may introduce himself first and also introduce his Wizard 'familiar'.  Having a dragon familiar requires the mage to tollerate such behaviour.<Color=White>

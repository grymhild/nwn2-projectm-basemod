An skeleton is perhaps the most primitive of undead for necromancers to create, with perhaps the exception of zombies.  While they have a certain frailty to bludgeoning weapons they are resistance to piercing weapons amd all the usual immunities that undead are blessed with.

As the Necromancer advances he is able to purchase his Skeleton better weapons and armour and pour more magical energies into it making it stronger.  Over time the almost mindless Skeleton transforms into a thinking creature capable of determining its own course of actions.

Skeletons can cast Death Armour a number of times per day depending on their level.

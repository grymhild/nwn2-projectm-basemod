Nymphs are fey creatures who delight in dancing, singing, and the playful seduction of mortals.  Nymphs are capable of altering their appearance at will and have some healing abilities.  When bonded as a familiar, usually a complicated chase on the part of the Wizard to entice the Nymph, they change their appearance to please their master.  Normally Nymphs are only bonded by male Wizards or Sorcerers, but occasionally females of a certain peruasion will bond one.

The Winter Wolf is half animal, half magical beast.  It thrives in extreme cold, but is vulnerable to fire.  It's bite causes cold damage and it is capable of breathing a cone of frost, increasing in uses as it grows.  Its skin when young is not so tough, but as it grows it becomes stronger and more resistant.

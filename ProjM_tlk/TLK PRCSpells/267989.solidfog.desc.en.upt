A bank of fog billows out from the point you designate. The fog obscures all sight, including Darkvision, beyong 5 feet. A creature withing 5 feet has concealment (20 % miss chance). Creatures farther away have Total Concealment (50 % miss chance, and the attacker cant use sight to locate the target). Any creature attempting to move through the fog progresses at a speed of 5 feet, regardless of it's normal speed, and it takes a -2 penalty on all melee attack rolls. The vapors prevent effective ranged attacks (except for magic rays and the like).

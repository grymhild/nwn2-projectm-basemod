This spell summons a thunderstorm that rains fire rather than raindrops down on you and everything within the affected area. Everything unprotected from the flaming deluge takes 1d6 points of fire damage each round. A successful Reflex save results in no damage, but the saving throw must be repeated each round. The fiery storm is stationary and persists even if the caster leaves.

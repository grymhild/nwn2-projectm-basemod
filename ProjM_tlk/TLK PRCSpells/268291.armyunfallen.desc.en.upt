In the heat of battle, there are times when odds begin to stack against you. These odds climb exponentially higher if allies begin to fall. With a casting of this powerful spell, you will restore all deceased allies to full life and vigor. In addition, any allies (including yourself), that may have sustained injuries are healed to complete health. You do not have to be in the vicinity of your allies for them to receive the benefits of this spell. However, while all allies are either healed or resurrected, this spell does not save them from whatever situation might have caused their demise; Fallen allies are raised where they fell, the injured are healed where they stand.

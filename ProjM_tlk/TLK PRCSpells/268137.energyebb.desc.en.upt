School:    Necromancy (Evil)
Level:  Cleric 7, Sorc/Wiz 7
Duration: 1 round/level
Saving throw: Fortitude negates

This spell functions like enervation except that the creature struck gains negative levels over an extended period. You point your finger and utter the incantation, releasing a black needle of crackling negative energy that suppresses the life
force of any living creature it strikes. You must make a ranged touch attack to hit. If the attack succeeds, the subject immediately gains one negative level, then continues to gain another each round thereafter as her life force slowly bleeds away. The drain can only be stopped by a successful Heal check (DC 23) or the application of a heal, restoration, or greater restoration spell.

If the black needle strikes an undead creature, that  creature gains 4d4 * 5 temporary hp that last for up to 1 hour.

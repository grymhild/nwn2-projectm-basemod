Psionic Salvo destroys the mental capacities of a creature. If the subject fails it Will save, it falls into an ever-worsening state of feeblemindedness. Each round the subject attempts a Will saving throw, and if failed loses another point of Intelligence and Wisdom, until the creature bottoms out at 3 for both ability scores.

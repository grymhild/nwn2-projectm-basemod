Tiger Claw (Strike)
Level: Swordsage 2, Warblade 2
Initiation Action: 1 standard action
Range: Melee attack
Target: One creature

For a split second, you unleash the barely controlled, primal rage that surges within you. As part of this maneuver, you make a single melee attack. You gain a +4 bonus on this attack roll and deal an extra 2d6 points of damage. You take a minus 4 penalty to AC until the start of your next turn, as this wild strike sends you off balance and hinders your defenses.

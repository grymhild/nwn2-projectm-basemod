Type of Feat: General
Prerequisite: Ability to rage, shift, or wild shape; one Tiger Claw maneuver.
Specifics: While you are in a rage, shifted, or wild shaped into an animal form, you can attempt to knock back 5 feet a creature of your size category or smaller that you hit with a Tiger Claw strike unless it succeeds on a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Str modifier). This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity.

Use: Automatic.

Diamond Mind (Counter)
Level: Swordsage 2, Warblade 2
Initiation Action: 1 immediate action
Range: Personal
Target: You

Your mind is a keenly honed weapon. Other warriors rely on their physical talents. You know that a mix of mental acuity and martial training, along with a strong sword arm, is an unbeatable combination. This maneuver epitomizes your approach. Your mind, rather than your raw reflexes, dictates your defenses. 

You use this maneuver any time you would be required to make a Reflex save. You roll a Concentration check instead of the Reflex save and use the result of that check to determine the save's success. You use this maneuver before you roll the Reflex save.

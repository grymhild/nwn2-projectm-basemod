Tiger Claw (Stance)
Level: Swordsage 1, Warblade 1
Prerequisite: One Tiger Claw maneuver
Initiation Action: 1 swift action
Range: Personal
Target: You
Duration: Stance

While you are in this stance, you whip yourself into a terrible rage. When you score a critical hit against an opponent, you enter a near frenzied state from the sight and smell of blood. You gain a +1 bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls. Because this is an untyped bonus, it stacks with each successful critical hit you score. If you go more than 1 minute without achieving a critical hit, you no longer gain the benefit of the stance.

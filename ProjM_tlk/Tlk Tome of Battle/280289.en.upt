Devoted Spirit (Stance)
Level: Crusader 1, Saint 1
Initiation Action: 1 swift action
Range: Personal
Target: You
Duration: Stance

While you are in this stance, you or an ally within 30 feet heals 2 points of damage each time you make a successful melee attack (but not an attack of opportunity). This healing represents the vigor, drive, and toughness you inspire in others. Your connection to the divine causes such inspiration to have a real, tangible effect on your allies' health. Each time you hit an opponent in melee, you heal the most injured member of your party within range.  If that party memeber is out of range you heal yourself instead.

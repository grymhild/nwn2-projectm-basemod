In the blink of an eye, you make your move.  Your speed, reflexes, and boundless confidence combine to allow you to make a fast, bold move that catches your foes off guard.

You must currently be in a move action to initiate this maneuver.  For six seconds your movement speed doubles.  Additionally, if you have already expended your swift or immediate action for the round, you instantly recover its use.  Quicksilver Motion can only be initiated once per six seconds.  A Warblade cannot use this maneuver to bypass the use of a swift action to recover maneuvers.

Setting Sun (Counter)
Level: Swordsage 1
Initiation Action: 1 immediate action
Range: Melee attack
Target: One creature

With this counter, you can attempt to redirect a creature that intends to make an attack against you. Immediately before the creature makes its attack, you make the better of an opposed Strength or Dexterity check against it. The target makes its check using the same ability you used for your check. If you are of a larger size category than the attacking creature, you use your superior bulk to redirect your foe and gain a +4 bonus on your Strength check. If you are of a smaller size category, you use leverage, misdirection, and trickery to gain a +4 bonus on your Dexterity check. If you succeed on the Strength or Dexterity check, the creature does not get to attack you. You then move it ten feet in the direction you are facing when it comes within range, away from you. If you fail the Strength or Dexterity check, the creature gains a +4 bonus on its attacks for the next round of combat.

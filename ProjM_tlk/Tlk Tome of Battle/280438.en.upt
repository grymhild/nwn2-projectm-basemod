White Raven (Strike)
Level: Crusader 1, Warblade 1
Initiation Action: 1 standard action
Range: Melee attack
Target: One creature
Duration: Six seconds

As a White Raven adept, you are as much a tactician as you are a war leader. You learn to create openings for your allies to maximize the teamwork and esprit de corps that you foster. You know that for a group to succeed, it must work together, and that individual glory must be set aside so that the group can achieve victory.

If this strike hits, both you and your target take a penalty to attack rolls equal to your ranks in Diplomacy minus four, divided by four, to a minimum of a minus one penalty to attack rolls.

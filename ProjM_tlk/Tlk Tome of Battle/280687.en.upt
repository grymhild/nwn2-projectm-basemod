At first level you are have the option to retrain your bonus feat (two if you are a Human or a Strongheart Halfling).  You must meet a feat's prerequisites if you chose to do so.

Only certain feats are available to retrain.  You cannot retrain a class feature or racial ability, nor a proficiency, history, background, metamagic, item creation, spellcasting, or epic feat.

Do not try to exchange a feat`s prerequisite to gain it (ex: losing Combat Expertise to gain Whirlwind Attack).  This will cause you to lose the one feat and not gain the other, essentially making you lose a feat forever.

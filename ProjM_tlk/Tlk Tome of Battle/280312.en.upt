Range: Personal

Between your devoted study, iron will, and supreme focus, you have learned to resist attempts to subvert your willpower. When you feel such an effect try to cloud your mind, you can draw on untapped reserves of energy to counter the attempt. 

You can use this maneuver any time before you would be required to make a Will save. You make a Concentration check and use the result of that check to determine the success of the next save you make against will. You must use this maneuver before you attempt the Will save.

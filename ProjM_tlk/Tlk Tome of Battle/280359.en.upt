Setting Sun (Stance)
Level: Swordsage 1
Initiation Action: 1 swift action
Range: Personal
Target: You
Duration: Stance

You are so closely attuned to your environment that you easily pick out steady spots in rough terrain. While others struggle to move over broken ground, you slip across it with ease. When you fight on rough ground, you turn the uneven footing into an advantage. By gauging how an opponent distributes his weight, you strike at just the right moment and in the precise spot needed to send him tumbling to the ground. 

While you are in this stance, you do not break a charge when moving over uneven terrain.  Furthermore, your connection with your environment grants you a damage immunity bonus of five percent, of a type determined by the terrain you are currently standing on.

Type of Feat: Class
Prerequisite: Warblade level 1.
Specifics: You qualify for feats that usually require a minimum number of fighter levels (such as Weapon Specialization) as if you had a fighter level equal to two minus your warblade level.

You also have the flexibility to adjust your weapon training.  After each rest you can change the designated weapon for any feat you have that applies only to a single weapon (such as Weapon Focus, but not Discipline Focus: Weapon Focus). The newly designated weapon is the weapon you have equipped. For example, if you wish to change the designated weapon for your Weapon Focus feat from greatsword to longsword, you must have a longsword equipped when you activate this feat.

When you adjust a feat in this way, you adjust all of the feats that specifically require the weapon as a prerequisite.  For instance, if you have both Weapon Focus (longsword) and Weapon Specialization (longsword), you change the designated Weapon Focus and you also change the weapon for Weapon Specialization in the same way.

Use: Selected, once per rest.

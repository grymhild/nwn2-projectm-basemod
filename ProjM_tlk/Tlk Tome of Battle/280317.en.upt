Diamond Mind (Strike)
Level: Swordsage 1, Warblade 1
Initiation Action: 1 standard action
Range: Melee attack
Target: One creature

The sapphire nightmare blade is one of the most basic, but important, maneuvers that a Diamond Mind adept studies.  It illustrates that a keen mind can pierce even the toughest defenses. 

You attempt a Concentration check as part of this maneuver, using the target creature's AC as the DC of the check. You then make a single melee attack against your target. The attack is also part of this maneuver. If your Concentration check succeeds, the target is flat-footed against your attack, and you deal an extra 1d6 points of damage. If your check fails, your attack is made with a minus two penalty and deals normal damage.

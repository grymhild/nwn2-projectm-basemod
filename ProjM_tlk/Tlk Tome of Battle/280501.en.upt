Type of Feat: Class
Prerequisite: Warblade level 3.
Specifics: Starting at 3rd level, you gain a bonus equal to your Intelligence modifier when you make rolls to confirm critical hits on maneuvers.  On half of your standard attacks, a separate roll is made and results in an occasional burst of damage if the roll would normally threaten and confirm a critical hit.  Your Intelligence modifier is added to the confirmation roll.  This results in the same amount of average damage over time as a direct increase to your critical confirmation modifier, but the damage is more reliably applied.

Type of Feat: Class
Prerequisite: Crusader level 13.
Specifics: Beginning at 13th level, if you succeed on a Fortitude or Will save against an attack that would normally produce a lesser effect on a successful save (such as a spell with a saving throw entry of Will half or Fortitude partial), you instead negate the effect.

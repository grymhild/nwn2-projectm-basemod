Tiger Claw (Strike)
Level: Swordsage 3, Warblade 3
Prerequisite: One Tiger Claw maneuver
Initiation Action: 1 standard action
Range: Melee attack
Target: One creature

With a carefully timed leap, you jump over the target's defenses and attack it from an unexpected angle. You can use this maneuver only against a foe of a larger size category than yours. As part of this maneuver, you make a Jump check with a DC equal to your foe's AC. If this check succeeds, you also make a melee attack as part of this maneuver. If the check fails, you cannot make this attack and the maneuver is still considered expended. You gain a +4 bonus on the attack roll and deal an extra 6d6 points of damage if your attack hits.

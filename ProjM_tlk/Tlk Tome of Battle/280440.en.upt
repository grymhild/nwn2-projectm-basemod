When you make an attack, your allies take heart in your example and fight with renewed purpose. By stoking the fire of battle in your allies' hearts, you inspire them to greater heroics. As part of this maneuver, you make a single melee attack. If your attack is successful, your allies gain a +4 bonus on attack rolls for six seconds against the creature you hit.

The White Raven discipline teaches that he who seizes the initiative also seizes victory. You have learned to lead an attack with a mighty charge, the better to disrupt the enemy and inspire your allies in battle. As part of this maneuver, you charge an opponent. You do not provoke attacks of opportunity for moving as part of this charge. If your charge attack hits, it deals an extra 10 points of damage.

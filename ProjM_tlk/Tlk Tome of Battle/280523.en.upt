Type of Feat: Class
Prerequisite: Crusader level 1st.
Specifics: You begin each encounter with one additional readied maneuver granted. This feat also applies when you determine a new set of granted maneuvers after recovering expended maneuvers. For example, if you are a 5th-level crusader, you normally begin an encounter or finish recovering expended maneuvers with two of your five readied maneuvers granted, and the remaining three maneuvers withheld. With this feat, three of your five readied maneuvers are granted, and only two are withheld. Naturally, this benefit provides you with a better array of maneuver options early in a battle.

Use: Automatic.

Special: This feat applies only to maneuvers readied by Crusaders.

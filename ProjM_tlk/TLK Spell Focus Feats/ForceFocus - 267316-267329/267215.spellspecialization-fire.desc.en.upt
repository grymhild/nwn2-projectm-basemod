Type of Feat: General
Prerequisite: Greater Spell Enhance (Fire).
Specifics: A character with this feat is adept in a certain type of magic at the expense of another type of magic, increasing both the DC by 2 and the power of the spell by 2 levels above the casters normal level thus allowing extra damage. However they also become weaker at the opposite type of magic (cold) and those spells have their DC lowered by 4 and their power reduced by 4. Note that specializing in the opposite type of magic effectively removes this feats benefit.
Use: Automatic. This feat may be selected multiple times, but the effects do not stack. It applies to a different school or type of magic in each case.

Type of Feat: General
Prerequisite: Spell Enhance (Fire).
Required for: Spell Specialization (Fire).
Specifics: A character with this feat is adept in a certain type of magic, allowing him to exceed any limits or maximums to caster level by another 2 for a total of 4. If a spell of 3rd level does 1d6 per caster level to a maximum of 10d6, this would change that maximum to 14d6. This would not increase it beyond the amount granted per level but allows such spells to not be as limited in power as the caster gains in levels. 
Use: Automatic. This feat may be selected multiple times, but the effects do not stack. It applies to a different school or type of magic in each case.

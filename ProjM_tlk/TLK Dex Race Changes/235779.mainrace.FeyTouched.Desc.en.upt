<color=Gold><b>Feytouched</b></color>

The fey are known for their curiousity (some would say obsession) with humanoids and giants, and sometimes a fey falls in love with one of these creatures. The creatures known as feytouched are offsprings of half-fey and either a humanoid or a giant as ancestors. Feytouched are a widely varied group of beings--some are wispy and beautiful, while others are ugly and brutish. Some resemble elves, with pointed ears and almond shaped eyes. Others look more like trolls, with warty skin and disproportioned limbs. 

The most common variant of feytouched are humans with fey ancestors known as wechselbalger. More rare to see are the undas who share the heritage of aquatic fey.

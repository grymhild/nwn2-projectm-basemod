<color=Gold><b>Planetouched</b></color>

"The voice of an angel." "A devilish sense of humor." "A heart of stone." For members of the races collectively known as "planetouched" these are more than just figures of speech; they are quite often the literal truth. All of the planetouched races are crossbreeds, part mortal and part-- something else. While the exact nature of that "something else" is different for each of the races, all their heritages do have one thing in common - they are not of the Material Plane. The planetouched's blood runs thick with essence of the other Planes of existence. The otherworldly gifts provided by this heritage could either be the result of being a descendant of a planar being, or simply having been conceived or born under unusual conditions.

The effects of having a supernatural being in one's heritage last for many generations. Although not as dramatically altered as a half-celestial or a half-fiend, planetouched still retain some special qualities.

The most common varieties of planetouched are genasi, aasimar, and tieflings, though many other kinds of planetouched do exist within the Great Ring. The genasi have an quasi-elemental heritage, influenced by air, earth, fire, water or wood. Aasimar are mortals with some trace of celestial blood in their veins, and tieflings, as well as fey'ri, krinth and tanarukks have fiends in their family tree.

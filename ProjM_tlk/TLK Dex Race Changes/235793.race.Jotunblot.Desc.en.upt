Three thousand years ago, an empire of giants with the name of Ostoria stretched across the mountains of Faerun. No one knows exactly when, how, or why the colossal kingdom collapsed -- some say the collapse came in the wake of an epic struggle against an armada of dragons; others say the empire fell amidst friction between the giant tribes themselves. The glory of ancient Ostoria may be gone, but the giants themselves and their descentends live on; the last of the ancient tribes maintain scattered strongholds near the Endless Ice Sea, a lone and tormented stone giant carves incredible sculptures from the ancient mountains overlooking the Dragon Coast, and fire giant shamans dance along the rims of volcanoes located amidst the Thunder Peaks. Today, the thundering footsteps and ear-splitting taunts of the Jotunbrud (Jo-tunn-brood, as giants refer to themselves in their ancient tongue) are occasionally heard from the wastes of the Savage North to the plains of the Shining South.

Those who are descendents of the giants which ruled the once mighty mountain spanning empire of Ostoria in ages long past are known as Jotnarnblots (or giant-blooded in the modern common tongue). There exist various kinds of Jotnarnblots across the corners of Faerun. Some of the more common ones to be found are Eldblots, Fjellblots, Frostblots and Tokeblots.

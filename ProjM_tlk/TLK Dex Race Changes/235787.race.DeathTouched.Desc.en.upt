<color=Gold><b>Deathtouched</b></color>

The deathtouched trace their ancestry to dhampirs, necropoliticans, pregnant humanoids which got infused with negative energy, or the victims of bungled ressurections. Although rarely recognized as such, the taint of unlife lingers through generations, and a deathtouched manifests abilities and characteristics derived from its unliving ancestors.

Most races do not trust creatures that are undead, in whole or otherwise, and a deathtouched whose ancestry has been exposed is likely to be driven off or killed. Followers of Lathander and some elves consider them abominations that must be hunted down to extinction.Certtain cults of death gods treat deathtouched with respect, though, and necromancers might welcome them in exchange for skin, hair, and blood samples, which are invaluable to their experimences.

The most common deathtouched are the mortif: humans who are forever tainted under the shadow of unlife.

<color=Gold><b>Goblinoid</b></color>

Goblinoids are a race of closely related humanoids also known (incorrectly) as goblins. It is believed by some scholars that some of the goblinoid races were purposefully bred by the hobgoblin race, who often dominate goblinoid communities. The typical goblinoid is lewd, cruel, sadistic, power-hungry (or in the case of goblins, just plain hungry), extremely lacking in any intelligence or sophistication, and proud of it. Known for their habit of abusing those (at least by thier reckoning) lesser than them, and worshiping those greater than them, goblinoids are not popular amongst other races. While exceptions do exist (though none are noted, as an atypical goblinoid rarely makes it out of its clan alive), this description pretty much describes the ethics and existence of goblinoids throughout the Realms. 

Notable examples of the goblinoid include, but are not limited to, the goblin, hobgoblin, bugbear, batiri, and sewer goblin.

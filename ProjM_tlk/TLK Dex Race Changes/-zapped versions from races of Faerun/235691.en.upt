<color=Gold><b>Half-Orc</b></color> 

Most probably think that breeds between humans and mountain orcs are the only half-orcs. However, there exist far more orc halfbreeds in Faerun than that. Orcs breed with almost any humanoid race (and non-humanoid races too on that matter), though most of them are sterile. 

Some of the more noticeable orc crossbreeds are the common half-orcs, the brutish ogrillons, and the bestial boogins.

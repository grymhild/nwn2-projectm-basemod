The character with this feat can both understand and can be understood anything that is said regardless of language. If the character says it everyone who hears it can understand it, and the character can understand anything that is said.This only affects intelligent sentient creatures, and is blocked per creature by things such as mind blanks and the like. Constructs and golems are also not able to benefit.This is actually a very weak form of telepathic/magical mind reading which helps everyone understand a language they normally would not understand.

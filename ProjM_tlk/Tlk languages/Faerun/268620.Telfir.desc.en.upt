The language is also called Telfir. It used the draconic alphabet, and is mainly found in dusty tomes, quite a few of which cover what is known about shadow magic written by Verraketh the Shadowking.The Talfir were a fair skinned human tribe in the heart of the great forest of Shantel Othreier, and the original human inhabitants of the Chionthar river valley in the Western Heartlands. They disappeared over a thousand years ago, replaced by refugees from low Netheril, Calishite settlers and Chondathan settlers from the Dragon Coast. The Talfir are said to be the first worshippers of numerous deities, including Tempus who vanquished the Netherese god of war.Little is left of them in the way of ruins or artifacts.  Irieabor lies atop the ancient crypt of the Talfir monarch known as Verraketh the Shadowking, who mastered shadow magic. Talis, a ruined city of the Talfir, lies in ruins along the banks of the River Reaching in the depths of the Reaching Woods.

Midani is the language of Zakhara. Both Untheric and Midani are deriviative of the Untheric langauge family, and Midani itself is derived from Jaanti which is from all four elemental planes.It uses the Thorass runic alphabet.Alzhedo is spoken at court, in all government and judicial proceedings, and throughout polite Calimshan society.It is said the first civilizations in the Calimshan area were made up of travelers from the elemental plane of air, largely based on the similarities between Alzhedo and Auran which are considerable, but the history of Untheric, Midani, and Jaanti which we know Alzhedo was derived from, all of them are strongly related to the plane of air. It is thought that their language has become much more like Auran due to constant contact with Genie kind from that plane.Common Alzhedo surnames included Basha, Dumein, Jassan, Khalid, Mostana, Pashar, and Rein.Alzhedo is one of the major root tongues of Thorass ( "Old Common" ) and Common.

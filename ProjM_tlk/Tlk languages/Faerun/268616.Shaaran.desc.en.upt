It was also sometimes spoken among the gold dwarves of the Great Rift, the wild elves of Chondalwood, and the wood elves of The Wealdath, and the halflings of Luiren. Even planetouched creatures and wemics are known to speak it.Speakers of the Shaaran tongue use the Dethek alphabet of the dwarves.Speakers of Shaaran employ an alphabet of Dethek runes, adopted from the gold dwarf traders of the Great Rift before the Rise of the Shoon Empire.Shaarans speak Shaaran, a language that has no connection with any other language family in Faerun. The language has adopted some words from other cultures over the centuries, particularly with the coming of traders to the region. Few Shaarans can read or write because the culture relies on oral history. Those who have learned to scribe the Shaaran language employ the Dethek alphabet, learned from the gold dwarves in the Great Rift.

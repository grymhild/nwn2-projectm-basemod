CommonTrade LangaugeFamily: Thorass ( a la Italic: Latin, Italian, French )SubGroup: Central ThorassAlphabet: ThorassRegions Spoken: Dificulty: 5Common is the trade language of Faerun. Almost every sentient civilized being speaks a smattering of it and most are fluent. While most cannot read or write the language, generally, the people of Faerun will be able to converse with each other in this language.Dialects vary from region to region, but generally, communication should be possible. For example, Bruenor Battlehammer has a distinct Scottish-style "accent", while his companion Drizzt Do'Urden seems to speak like a scholar, with little trace of inflection in the video games Baldur's Gate 2: Dark Alliance and Forgotten Realms: Demon Stone. Sometimes, an archaic form of common will be encountered, such as spoken by Elminster Aumar, complete with "thees" and "thous."In other realms, "common" may be a different form. An example is the Underdark, as the residents there speak what is known as Undercommon. Inhabitants of different planes might also speak different forms of "common".Limitations and AdvantagesAccording to Faerunian linguists, Common developed out of a pidgin variant of the Jhaamdathan language called Thorass, and thus is most closely related to that language. However, it has its disadvantages; not every concept can be easily related to others. Nuances of speech, names, and phrases can be expressed easier in older languages such as Illuskan and Dwarven.The obvious advantage to Common is that practically every sentient in the universe can speak it. Even in remote areas of Faerun like Murghim, Samarach, and the Great Glacier, the inhabitants can speak at least enough of it to make themselves understood with a little creative pantomiming. Admittedly regional accents have a tendency to confuse the issue; natives of distant areas may regard each others' accents as strange or silly, but they can still understand each other.History and AlphabetAs has been previously stated, the direct ancestor of Common was a language called Thorass, which an unknown scribe eventually developed a written alphabet for. Thorass is now a dead language (meaning that nobody speaks it on a daily basis anymore), but the alphabet survives, and is now used in languages such as Common, Chessentan, Rashemi and Uluik.There is a great deal of evidence that Thorass is derived in part from older incarnations of Jotun, the language of giants, along with other unknown (probably Jhaamdathan - which is now Chondathan ) influences.The common tongue evolved from Thorass, a trade language that started in the area between the borders of Jhaamdath and Calimshan (around the Lake of Steam) a couple thousand years ago (give or take). After Calimshan and Jhaamdath got tired of fighting and began to settle into trade relations, Thorass sprang up as sort of a trade pigin to facilitate bargaining between traders of those two nations and other peoples who lived in that region.Thorass (ancient Common) was a synthesis of Jhaamdathan and Alzhedo--the language of Calimshan. Alzhedo was itself a mix of Midani (the language spoken by humans in Zakhara) and Auran, the language of the elemental plane of Air and also the language of the Djinni nobility that had enslaved Zakharan humans and then migrated to the Southwestern Faerun to establish what would later become Calimshan.So modern common is a sister language of Chondathan (modern Jhaamdathan) and Alzhedo, and is probably 50% mutually comprehensible to native speakers of either race, or would be except that everyone pretty much knows common (or enough to get by), so Common is really close to 100% comprehensible to pretty much everybody.The Calimshites spread Common up the Sword Coast and around the Shining Sea in their trading, while the Jhaamdathans spread Common around the Sea of Fallen Stars with their mercantile endeavors. Then, after Jhaamdath fell, the surviving Jhaamdathans, who over time came to be called Chondathans, spread out across Faerun in a vast diaspora, spreading both their native Chondathan language and culture, and also the Common trade tongue for negotiating with speakers of the other languages they found when they got to wherever they migrated to.

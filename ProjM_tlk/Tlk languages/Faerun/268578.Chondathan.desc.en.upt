Thorass alphabet.The Chondathan tongue was spoken in and around Waterdeep in addition to the ubiquitous Common and the northern language of Illuskan. Other regions where Chondathan was commonly spoken included: Amn, Cormyr, the Dalelands, the Dragon Coast, Sembia, the Silver Marches, Tethyr, the Western Heartlands, and the Vilhon Reach.Like the majority of Faerun's regional tongues, it used the Thorass runic alphabet.Chondathan was derived from Central Thorass and is related to Cormanthan and Northern.Typical Chondathan surnames include Amblecrown, Buckman, Dundragon, Evenwood, Greycastle, and Tallstag.Chondathans speak Common and Chondathan, two closely related tongues. Chondathan, one of the root tongues of Common, is the modern form of Jhaamdathan ("Old Chondathan"), which was one of the two root tongues of Thorass ("Old Common"), Chondathan employs the Thorass alphabet, a set of characters used to represent the trade tongue that came into use thousands of years ago along the shores of the Lake of Steam.As many Chondathans dwell amid other Human cultures (or at least have extensive trade contacts with such societies), many individuals learn the local tongue or the language of their nearest neighbor. Commonly learned second languages include Illuskan if the individual in question lives in the Western Hearlands or the North, Damaran if she lives in northcentral Faerun, Shaaran if she lives south of the Vilhon Reach, Turami if she lives on the northern shore of the Vilhon Reach, or Alzhedo if she lives along the shores of the Lake of Steam. Spellcasters, particularly those who dwell in Cormyr or the Dalelands, usually learn Netherese and Elven in order to acquire magic from old sources. Few Chondathans outside those areas learn Elven, a legacy of generations of conflict and a likely contributor to future conflicts.All Chondathan characters are literate except for barbarians.Chondathans speak Common and Chondathan, two closely related tongues.

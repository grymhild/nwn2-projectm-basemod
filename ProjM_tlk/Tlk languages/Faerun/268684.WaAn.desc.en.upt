Wa-AnOther Names: WaFamily: Han ( a la Sinitic: Chinese, Mandarin, Bai )SubGroup: HanAlphabet: DraconicRegions Spoken: Wa in Kara TurDificulty: 5Wa-an was a language spoken by the Wanese, inhabitants of Wa in Kara-Tur.Also known as Wa, the Wa-an language overflows with flowery terms and polite expressions. The proper use of many phrases is governed by etiquette rather than by grammar. Wit and clever turns of phrase are important social skills, often the subject of fiercely competitive (but very polite) contests.Written Wa-an is quite extensive. Short verse poems called haiku are one of the most popular forms of literature. Particularly clever and beautiful haiku are known to every citizen. Wa-an dialects reflect the distinct social classes found in Wa. Each dialect features the vocabulary needed by those who speak it. For example the farmers' dialect, No Wa-an, contains detailed agriculture terms that the otehr dialects don't have.

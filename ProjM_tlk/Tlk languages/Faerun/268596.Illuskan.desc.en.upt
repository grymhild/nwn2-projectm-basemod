Thorass alphabet.Illuskan is an ethnic human language spoken in northwest Faerun, largely by Illuskans. It is commonly used as a lingua franca along the Sword Coast North, in addition to the ubiquitous Common. Other regions where it is commonly spoken include Mintarn, the Moonshaes, Ruathym, and among the Uthgardt.Like the majority of Faerun's human tongues, Illuskan uses the Thorass runic alphabet.Illuskan is a derivative language of Illuski and is in the same family language as Truskan, Bothii and Reghedjic.Common Illuskan surnames include Brightwood, Helder, Hornraven, Lackman, Stonar, Stormwind, and Winddrivver.Most Illuskans speak Illuskan, a language derived largely from Old Illuskan (spoken by the folk of Old Illusk) mixed with a smattering of Netherese. They usually speak Common as well, but few are literate. Along the northern coast of the mainland, particularly in the city of Waterdeep, many Illuskans speak Chondathan, the language of their Tethyrian neighbors. Although Old Illuskan had an alphabet of its own, today it is only found in the ancient fragments of lore stored within the Host Tower of the Arcane in Luskan. Although rarely put in written form, the modern Illuskan tongue uses the Thorass alphabet introduced by Tethyrian migrants.All Illuskan characters are literate except for barbarians, aristocrats, commoners, experts, and warriors.Most Illuskans speak Illuskan, a language derived largely from Old Illuskan (spoken by the folk of old Illusk) mixed with a smattering of Netherese.

MidaniFamily: Untheric ( a la Semitic: Assyrian, Babylonian, Modern Arabic )SubGroup: MidaniAlphabet: ThorassRegions Spoken: Zakhara, the Bedine, Calimshan.Dificulty: 4Midani is the dominant tongue of Zakhara, the land of Fate, a continent far west of Faerun proper. Much like the Calishite Alzhedo tongue, it has strong roots in the native language of the Plane of Elemental Air, Midani has roots in the native languages of all of the Inner Elemental Planes.Spoken by the Bedine in the Anauroch as well as in Zakhara. Thorass alphabet.Zakharan (south, beyond the great sea) common. Very similar to the real world languages of Swahili and Arabic. Spoken in Durpar, Estagund and Var the Golden frequently.Midani is the common tongue of Zakhara. It is spoken by all "enlightened" citizens of that region as well as by most unenlightened savages of that land. A version of Midani is also spoken by the Bedine.Zakhara has five regional dialects. In the Pearl Cities, Midani is spoken with a sharp, precise rhythm, with the ends of sentences clipped off. In the Pantheist League, consonants are trilled, seemingly at random. In eastern Zakhara, Midani is spoken with a nasal accent. In Huzuz and Hiyal, the accent sounds flat and mechanical compared to other Midani speakers. The folk of Huzuz and Hiyal believe they speak the "true" version of the Midani tongue.Thieves' Cant is a choppy Midani lingo spoken only by rogues. It varies slightly from city to city.Maran is another dialect of Midani.Dead TonguesRelated to Midani are several forgotten languages no longer spoken by any living cultures. They include Noga and Kadari (from the Ruined Kingdoms). Other dead languages once spoken in the Zakhara region, such as Affa, Drow Elven, and Chun, are apparently not related to Midani.Like Mulhorandi, Mahjuri, Alzho, and Untheric, Midani is part of the Rauric language family. It is specifically part of the Untheric language group, like Untheric and Alhzo. All Rauric languages are derived, at least in part, from the slave argot of ancient Imaskar.Midani has roots all four elemental tongues. This probably means it's partly descended from Jannti, the language of the genie races.In -339 DR, Bedine nomads migrated through a portal from Zakhara to the Anauroch Desert, intermingling with a handful of Netherese survivors. The Bedine retained their ancestral Midani tongue, but lost all knowledge of the written version of that tongue. Centuries later, traders from surrounding lands introduced the Thorass alphabet to the Bedine, which they use to this day instead of the historical Midani alphabet.

Abjuration [Cold]Level:	Drd 2, Sor/Wiz 4Components:	V, S, MCasting Time:	10 minutesRange:	TouchTarget:	Object touchedDuration:	Permanent until discharged (D)Saving Throw:	Reflex half; see textSpell Resistance:	YesFrost trap creates a fiery explosion when an intruder opens the item that the trap protects. A Frost trap can ward any object that can be opened and closed.When casting Frost trap, you select a point on the object as the spell's center. When someone other than you opens the object, a fiery explosion fills the area within a 5-foot radius around the spell's center. The flames deal 1d4 points of Frost damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +20). The item protected by the trap is not harmed by this explosion.A frost trapped item cannot have a second closure or warding spell placed on it.A knock spell does not bypass a frost trap. An unsuccessful dispel magic spell does not detonate the spell.Underwater, this ward deals half damage and creates a large cloud of steam.You can use the frost trapped object without discharging it, as can any individual to whom the object was specifically attuned when cast. Attuning a frost trapped object to an individual usually involves setting a password that you can share with friends.Note: Magic traps such as frost trap are hard to detect and disable. A rogue (only) can use the Search skill to find a frost trap and Disable Device to thwart it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level (DC 27 for a druid's frost trap or DC 29 for the arcane version).Material ComponentA half-pound of gold dust (cost 25 gp) sprinkled on the warded object.

AuranFamily: Mulani ( a la Hamitic: Ancient Egyptian, Coptic, Berber )Alphabet: AuranekRegions Spoken:  Elemental Plane of AirDificulty: 4Auran is a language of the elemental plane of air. It is largely derived from Aragrakh, the ancient language of dragons who frequented both the plane of air and the plane of fire. It is spoken by most residents of the plane of air, followers of the deities of the air, and intelligent air elementals.Auran sounds like a quiet whooshing, and most creatures mistake it for the frequent winds on the plane of air. It is a breathy soft spoken language.The Auran language inspired the Jaanti language. The avian creator race also spoke a language called Aearee which is largely based on Auran.

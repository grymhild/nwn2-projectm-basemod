It is based on the drow language which is the basis of under common, and which is itself based on elven.

Drow nobles are also known to say one thing aloud in Takanesti, while at the same time saying the opposite in drow sign, often allowing them to be diplomatic while ordering their followers to attack.There is no written form.

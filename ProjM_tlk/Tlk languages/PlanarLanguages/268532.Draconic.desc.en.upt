DraconicFamily: DraconicAlphabet: DraconicRegions Spoken: DragonsDificulty: 2Draconic is the modern language of dragons, based largely on the primordial dragon tongue of Aragrakh. It is spoken by dragons and Wyverns. It influenced and created the langauges of kobolds, lizardfolk and troglodytes. It is one of the oldest languages still spoken.It is also largely known by Mages and clerics of Mystra who use it as the language of magic. This does not let them speak to dragons, since the arcane notation is just a portion of the full language, but as a mage becomes more proficient he is likely to understand more words. Any dragon can easily read arcane notation however.The writing system of Draconic was developed by their kobold scribes in the distant past. Writing is not something dragons needed both due to their almost perfect memory, but also since their physical forms. Kobolds on the other hand saw it as very much needed, and proceeded to record much of their draconic masters musings, with a language very similar to Dwarven Dethek. This is used by many languages, inlcuding the elemental languages of Auran and Ignan, the much older draconic language of Aragrakh.Punctuation is the same as english, with the exception of a special character consisting of six lines radiating outwards, similar to a fireburst ( * ). When this character is writtn, the word is spoken with the first and last syllable stressed. Dragons often use this when referring to themselves, for example, the dragon Karajix would be written *Karajix* and pronounced "KA-raj-IX".Draconic is a language of hard consonants and sibilants that usually sounds like hissing when spoken. It inculdes sounds that sound very snake-like to humans, including: sj, ss, and sv. It also includes a sound similar to a creature clearing its throat, like the German "ach". Words which modify other words can be place before, or after, the words they modify, however the most important word is always placed before, and sometimes, for added emphasis, might be added after, as well. So, a dragon that wanted to say a big, black, evil dragon was coming near, but wanted to emphasise might say: Malsvir darastrix turalisj vutha gethrisj leirith [evil dragon big black go near]Or Malsvir darastrix turalisj vutha malsvir gethrisj leirith [evil dragon big black evil go near]Genrally, the Draconic sentence follows the order of Subject Verb Object, though the Subject may be omitted if it is understood or part of a command. Also, if a sentence is a command, and written, is will often include the previously mentioned "fireburst" symbol (*). Draconic has no word for "my" or "mine", but uses a series of prefixes, depending on the exact meaning. An object that is claimed a dragon speaker would begin with "veth" or "vethi", a being with a relationship to the speaker, such as friend or relative, begins with "er" or "erthe", and all other forms of the possesive begin with "ar" or "ari". For example, for a dragon to say "my sword", or "the sword is mine", he only needs to say "vethicaex". Or, to say "my enemy", he would say "arirlim". To indicate possession by another, the name of the possessor is combined with the object into a single word and prefaced with "ar" or "ari". For example, to say "my enemy's sword" he would say "arirlimcaex".There are dialects of dragon for each of the various species of dragon, but the differences are very small and can often only be heard by dragons themselves. So, someone who learns Draconic from a red dragon will be able to understand, and make themselves understood by, a blue dragon or gold dragon. Draconic itself, has not changed in hundreds of years.

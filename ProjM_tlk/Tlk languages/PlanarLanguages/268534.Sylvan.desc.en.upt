SylvanOther Names: FaerieFamily: SylvanAlphabet: EspruarRegions Spoken: The Sylvan Plane of Faerie and by the Fey CourtDificulty: 3Sylvan is a language of nature, of the weather, and of poetry. It has a strong relationship to elvish as both sylvan and elvish derived from the original language of the sylvan plane. It is spoken by forest creatures like dryads, brownies and pixies. Nature deities and druids also use it, as do botanists and sages who study plants and animals. It is also the language of the Faerie Court, of Feywilde, and whereever the fey hold sway.It's most distinctive feature though is likely due to the love of sylvan creatures enjoyment of hearing words rhyme. Instead of changing their choice of words, they changed their language to sound better, which resulted in numerous word changes. However this has also at this point resulted in stability for the language since it is so easy to have things rhyme at this point why change it. You could describe this stability as being caused with a tendency to accidently notice the same joke, it's not intentional, but more of a groove fey thinking tends to drop them into.Right now however there is a pixie dialect which seems very likely headed towards splintering into a language of it's own. They are inventing so many new words that they are very hard to understand, not to mention they talk so quickly. But then most of the new words describe things like flowers in more and more detail. Of course pixies talk so very quickly that it's hard to understand them to begin with.Beyond the pixie's being hard to understand they still speak something that is considered sylvan, and their word changes might eventually also merge back into the main language at some point. The various fey creatures besides pixies tend to not have much differences in language as they all tend to communicate often between various races. The only fey creatures not sharing the same sylvan language were the elves since the elves formed their own communities.The language focuses a lot on describing natural events and effects, the seasons and plants and animals of the wild.Unknown to most besides druids, animals speak their own secret language based on sylvan which allows them to communicate between each other. It is a very simple language mostly to warn of danger or where good places to eat are.

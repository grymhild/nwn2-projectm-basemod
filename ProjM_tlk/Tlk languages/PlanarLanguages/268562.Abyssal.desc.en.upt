AbyssalPrimordial LanguageAlphabet: AbyssalRegions Spoken: The Abyss and by Chaotic Evil CommunitiesDificulty: 1The primordial language of hate, lust and suffering, a language corrupted by the extreme combination of both ignorance and rage the original demons seemed to hold as virtues.Like all primordial languages it is a language of power and magic, but it also grew dark to reflect those who spoke it. Where other primordial languages were ones of magic, of natural beauty, and of law, this can be truly called a language of ignorance that relishes its own corruption and destruction, and even it's every changing nature. They cared little if what they said was misunderstood, and tended to start fighting long before what is meant even matters, and grunting, jeers and obscenity. The only constants in this language are obscenities.It also became such a focus of it to criticise and belittle others, that words which compliment others were forgotten. In the demonic way of thinking saying love meant the same as lust, caressing equivalent to torture, sleeping to death. The resulting language made it impossible to be nice at all since every kind word happens to be replaced with a insult or threat. You could say kindness is alien to the races of the abyss as they need to learn another language to even know that such ideas exist.The abyssal alphabet is based on infernal, mainly due to the fact that most creatures of the abyss never really focus on learning to read, much less writing. However more educated demons adopted the writing system of their more refined devil brothers for their own language.The creatures of the Abyss and the creatures of hell both claim the other speaks a corrupted form of their language. While the Infernal language is much more refined, and the abyssal alphabet is based on infernal, it is clear from linguistic research that Abyssal is a primordial language which derived from the original primordial language of creation much like Primordial Fey, Logos, and Aragrakh. But regardless of facts, both demons and devils will hunt down and torture any who dispute their chosen point of view.The Abyssal toungue was the basis of infernal, goblin, orcish, and gnoll toungues, and had a strong influence on drow and undercommon.

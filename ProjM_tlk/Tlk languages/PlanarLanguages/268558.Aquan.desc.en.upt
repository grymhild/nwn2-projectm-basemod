AquanFamily: AquanAlphabet: AquanekRegions Spoken:  Elemental Plane of WaterDificulty: 4Aquan is a language of bubbly explanation, high pitched tones and deep resonating melodies which allow aquatic races to easily communicate in both the oceans and on the elemental plane of water. Most intelligent aquatic creatures speak it except for sea and aquatic elves, which is ironic since it is to a large degree based on their languages. Whales and dolphins also speak it.This language is derived from the ancient Sylvan which was spoken by the elves when they first established aquatic communities, it also has much influnce from Serusan which those elves now speak. As such it has much in common with both elvish and sylvan, which is obvious when looking at it in it's written form. However when spoken it does not seem to have any similarity since it uses many high pitched shrieks and tones which are better suited to underwater communication.The written form is called Aquanek, which is largely based on espruar but with much simpler letter forms, and is found in various aquatic tomes which generally are stone tablets, but there also are books which use paper made out of sea weeds and octopus ink.The oceans of both the world and the elemental plane of water echo with the deep songs of various creatures. The high pitched shrieks are mainly for casual conversation, but deep resonating tones carry far across the water, and allow creatures to hear each other across miles of water. By both practice and custom they sing mighty epics and lyrical poetry much more often then casual conversation.The languages of the Sea elves, Serusan is largely based on Aquan, as is the langauge of the Jaan, Jaanti which is based on all 4 elemental langages.

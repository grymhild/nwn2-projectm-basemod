PathosAlso Known As: SlaadiPlanar LanguageAlphabet: AbyssekRegions Spoken:  PandemoniumDificulty: 8Pathos is the language of the unspeakable, of raw emotions and whims, and everchanging grammar. Just trying to make sense of it is just impossible, and most conclude those speaking it are not speaking a language but are in fact pathologically insane. This is equally due to an alien way of thinking as it is a complete disrespect for there being any rules.Words and even letters vary almost randomly, with it sounding almost like the speaker is just saying random words from other languages in a endless run on sentence. The words chosen are just as likely to be entirely invented, generally known only to the speaker. Words being repeated, accented, pace of speaking, all of it vary based on how the speaker feels. Even the lack of grammar varies with it sounds sometimes like actual sentences.Those who speak it learn that it's less about what is said, than how it's said, as it's a language of nuance and requires some insight to understand. Generally even accomplished speakers only understand portions of what the other is saying, however by repetition of the same things in ever changing ways, both parties eventually learn what each other is saying.Which is both a strength and a weakness. If a creature has a totally original idea they need to say to another, for which there just is not a word for yet, this language works wonderfully, able to express the unknown where another language would fail for lack of word. It also is very easy to tell how other creatures feel as it's a language of raw emotions. However for mundane conversation this is far too much work compared to other languages. This is why it's called the language of the unspeakable, for despite it being ridiculously difficult to get an idea across, it is a language that is capable of communicating the normally unspeakable.It has much influence from Abyssek and Sylvan, well it is influenced by many languages as it freely appropriates words.It is also of note that there is a condition called "speaking in tongues" where a person sounds like they are speaking multiple languages, often they are in fact speaking Pathos.

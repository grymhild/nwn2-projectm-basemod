AragrakhPrimordial LanguageFamily: DraconicAlphabet: DraconicRegions Spoken: Dead LanguageDificulty: 7The primordial language of dragons, one of the oldest known languages in the planes, and old enough to even have been forgotten by most dragons, ancient though they may be. The only place it can still be found is in ancient magical tomes scribed from the begining of history and it's often mistaken for a undecipherable draconic. Just realizing a Tome is written in this and not just Draconic is often enough for a wise Sage to request the counsel of an Archmage lest they unleash some unspeakable ancient magic.It is also known as Old High Wyrm, and no longer spoken as of 1372 DR, and even then it was doubtful that anyone alive at the time knew the proper pronunciation. It comes from the era of the creator races, when dragons ruled the world, and even then it was an ancient toungue.This languages is one of the oldest known and seems to be related to the primordial language of creation. As such it is a language of magical power, and languages based on it tend to lend themselves well to magical theory and the recordings of spells.The written form was actually added long after this language was ancient and in decline, in fact it was kobolds, a race who in the beginning served dragons who saw the need to record what is said who developed the draconic alphabet to record the much more modern Draconic. Writing is not much use to dragons, but with kobold scribes they were able to record their history, their magical science, and other musings. The ancient dragons who still spoke Aragrakh at the time adapted it to record things in the older tongue.Aragrakh is the parent language of Sarakaar spoken by the saurial creator race, of which not much is left except the Yuan Ti language. It is also gave rise to modern Draconic, which in turn gave rise to YipYak the language of kobolds, and the magical arcane language. As such much of modern magic is based on it in one manor or another. Its influence on other languages is immense especially languages which focused on arcane lore. It is also a heavy influence on the languages of Auran and Ignan of the elemental planes of air and fire repectively.

TerranAlphabet: TarranekRegions Spoken: Elemental Plane of EarthDificulty: 2The terran language is spoken by the denizans of this realm of mostly solid rock, the elementals of earth, stone and metal, and the powers which call this realm home, and the jaani, and some humanoids that cling to pockets of air they mine. Most mortals only see that small portion of air pockets and tunnels, and think terra is mainly home to races of gnomes and dwarfs, and some jaani, but the actual plane is almost completely solid.The terran language is derived from the primordial language logos, the language of law and justice, but since on this plane there is not a lot of air for words to vibrate across it became much much deeper, and much more gravelly in their voice.Denizens of terra tend to speak slowly and little, ponder what is to be said for a great deal of time, and when they speak say the bare minimum in order to make sure everything they say is heard as they see speaking being considable amount of work. However once they make a statement they tend to be extremely stubborn and refuse to change their minds, often taking as long to change their minds as they did coming to the original decision even if it's being wrong is obvious.Their language is shaped as much by this stubborness, as it is by the denseness of their realm, where what is said has to be conveyed often over solid rock, and often conversations are mistaken for distant earthquakes. Terran is made of deep resonating tones, vibrations rumblings and patterns of slamming.When underground or on their home plane their language lets them communicate across vast distances. They communicate in various ways, some creatures cannot actually speak but instead hammer upon the ground itself rapidly, yet others are capable of doing this with their mouths. Likewise some hear via feeling the vibrations with their bodies and others listen with actual ears.Many humanoids living near their realm have taken to using various forms of drums to engage in such communication, mainly for use in commanding large battles, but also as a means of long range communication, and this practice is used by everything from the armies of heaven to brutish orcish armies. But unlike other races terrans can send much more complex messages.The terran language has two main races as offshoots, the great dwarven race focused on mining and shaping the treasures of the earth has in fact become the first terran race to develop written language. The practical dwarven language is called Dethek, and many languages base their writing upon this languages runes in addition to terran. Most terrans call their alphabet Tarranek but in fact it's almost exaclty like Dethek.The other language is that of the gnomes named gnim, a language of artifice and science, which focuses on mechanics and inventions.On faerun the ancient language of Roushoom traces it's lineage back to both Terran and to Logos, and is the basis for most Rauric and Imaskari languages.

EnchantmentLevel:	Brd 2, Clr 4, Sor/Wiz 3Components:	V, M/DFCasting Time:	1 standard actionRange:	TouchTarget:	Creature touchedDuration:	1 min./levelSaving Throw:	Will negates (harmless)Spell Resistance:	YesThis spell makes the touched creature unable to be understood, and instead of making any sense, all those who hear them can hear is babbling, reducing the target to rely on hand gestures to communicate. The victim magically learns the langauge but the language itself is not magical, and they also can understand any lanuage they normally know.This is not circumvented by comprehend languages, toungues, or other divinations which allow understanding what other people are saying.This does not affect spellcasting, but certain spells which require comprehension by the target ( power word, geas and command for example ) will not have any effect unless the speaker can make themselves understood.The babbling however is an actual language, if multiple targets are affected by this spell they can communicate in this babbeling language as long as they were all cast by the same caster. However they cannot be understood by others who are not currently affected by this spell, nor can they communicate with another victim of this spell who was affected by a different caster.This spell can be removed by the caster at will.This spell acts as a counter to Tongues and Comprehend Languages, and casting Babble on a creature who is using either Tongues or Comprehend Languages will remove the effects of those spells. Casting Tongues on a victim of the Babble spell will remove its effects. Whenever these spells remove their opposite spell, no other effects are applied.Arcane Material ComponentA small clay model of a ziggurat, which shatters when the verbal component is pronounced.

There are multiple dialects, but all types of dwarves can understand each other which makes it all the same language, but only High Dwarvish and Dwarf common dialects are really understandable to non dwarves.Dwarvish is a loud booming language that can be heard for miles under ground.Dwarves have a runic alphabet called Dethek, which is used by many other languages who have some affinity for creatures of the earth. As of 1357 DR it was the most common runic script. No punctuation was shown in Dethek. Sentences were usually separated by cross-lines of script, words were separated by spaces, and capital letters had a line drawn above them. Numbers which were enclosed in boxes were dates, with the day preceding the year. There were collective symbols of characters for identifying peoples, clans, tribes or races. If any runes were painted, names of beings and places were commonly picked out in red, while the rest of the text was colored black or left as unadorned grooves.Dialects of Dwarvish.Dwarf Common: Language used for trading between non dwarves.High Dwarvish: Language used for religious ceremonies, and by learned dwarves, or just when trying to be proper and not using any slang.Mithek: Mountain DwarfUrthek: Hill Dwarf.Dethek was used in the written forms of the Gnim ( Gnome ) language, Goblin language, Jotun ( Giant ) language, Orc language, and Terran.Dethek was also the base alphabet for the Damaran language, Shaaran language, Tashalan language and Untheric language of Faerun.

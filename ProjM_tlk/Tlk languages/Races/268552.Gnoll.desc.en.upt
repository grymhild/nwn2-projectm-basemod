GnollAlphabet: DethekRegions Spoken: Gnoll Communities and Temples of YeenoghuDificulty: 3The language of gnolls is usually remembered by the sinister laughing heard as they circle in for a kill. It is a language filled with yipping, giggling, barking and groaning, often disconcerting since gnolls tend to speak on top of each other making it sound like a crazed mob.This language is based on Ghukliak ( goblin ), with a strong commingling of Abyssek from their patron deity Yeenoghu. It, like most of the corrupted races, uses the Dethek alphabet of the dwarves.While they are pack animals with clearly defined leaders based on power, the pack itself acts capriciously almost with a mob mentality. Gnolls don't keep their thoughts to themselves, and instead constantly yip out exactly what they are thinking without regard to if others, even the pack leader is speaking. The pack as a whole will repeat and echo a clever or cruel idea almost as soon as they hear it, regardless of the desires of the pack leader or what they were doing before. How the pack acts is often completely random, depending on the whim of even the weakest member, however the pack leader can coax and threaten the pack as a whole to keep them on a defined course. As a race they lack almost any discipline because of this.The language has hundreds of ways to describe carrion, how rotten meat is, and how old a corpse is.The pitch used actually gets higher as the gnolls age, with pups having deeper sounds more like dogs. As they age their pitch gets higher until of course they are too old, at which point they are slain by the rest of the pack.Similar to languages which have articles or alternate forms of words to indicate gender, this language has both a submissive and dominant form. Gnolls are very careful to speak the proper tone depending on whether whom they are speaking to is more powerful or not, failure to use the proper tone by another will make gnolls immediately attack.

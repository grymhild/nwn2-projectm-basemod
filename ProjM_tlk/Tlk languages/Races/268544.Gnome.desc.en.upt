GnimOther Names: GnomeAlphabet: DethekRegions Spoken: Sages, Teachers, Gnome Communities and in Scientific Schools and LibrariesDificulty: 3Gnim is a language of scholars and sages, spoken by gnomes primarily in their studies of and writings. It is known for fluid tones and simple structure, but has an extraordinary vocabulary at the same time. It is well suited for academic, scientific, artistic and engineering due to this large vocabulary. It however does not effectively describe emotions or allow eloquence, and comes across as being dry and boring unless those hearing it are really interested in the subject matter.Gnomes actually don't use this language for everyday conversation, instead using languages like dwarven or the dominant language of the region they are in, as this language is very pedantic even for gnomes. It is used academcially by numerous other races since it allows accurate recording of facts and specific descriptions, and numerous ground breaking scholarly texts are written in Gnim.Gnomish literature covers a staggeering variety of topics, from histories and literature, to detailed surveys of species, geology and botany, as well as chronicalling their many engineering projects and automata.This language is derived from dwarven, and uses the dwarven alphabet Dethek.

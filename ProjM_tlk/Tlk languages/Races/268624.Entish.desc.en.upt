EntishOther Names: TreantFamily: SylvanAlphabet: EntishRegions Spoken: Treants the their Entish Communities and among trees.Dificulty: 4A language more of rustling noises and swaying movement than spoken words, spoken by these ever so patient creatures. A conversation with a treant is long winded, when using this language it is even more so. This is the language of the forest spoken by not just by the treants but the trees themselves, who whispering among themselves is hidden in the rustling of the leaves.Entish is derived from the Sylvan language.It uses the Entish alphabet.

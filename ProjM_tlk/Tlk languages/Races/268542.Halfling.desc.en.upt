HalflingOther Names: Luiric, HinAlphabet: ThorassRegions Spoken: Luiren mainly, but some halflings know it as well.Dificulty: 1Language of halflings. Written in Thorass (common alphabet.) Spoken by hin.Halfings are far too busy to bother with a language of their own. They use human tongues mostly, though will use the language of their neighbors in any case.( tentative data)The halfling language is a simplified derivative of elvish, soft and simple in its basic construction, but spoken with a variety of subtle tones and inflections to give meaning and character to the sounds.  As a result, even those familiar with elvish are unable to understand the halfling language without further study. Halflings speak their own language, which uses the Common script. They write very little in their own language, so, unlike dwarves, elves, and gnomes, they don't have a rich body of written work. The Halfling oral tradition, however, is very strong. While the Halfling language isn't secret, Halflings are loath to share it with others. Almost all Halflings speak Common, since they use it to deal with the people in whose lands they are living or through which they are traveling.

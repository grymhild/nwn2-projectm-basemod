<color=Gold><b>Gnome</b></color>

Gnomes are welcome everywhere as technicians, alchemists, and inventors. Despite the demand for their skills, most gnomes prefer to remain among their own kind, living in comfortable burrows beneath rolling, wooded hills where animals abound.

There are four races of gnomes: the commonly rock gnome, the shy forest gnome, the far less common and sullen deep gnome (also known as svirfneblin), and the foul spriggan.

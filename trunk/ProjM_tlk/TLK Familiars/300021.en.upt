A wizard rather than bonding with a living creature instead invest the magical energies involved with a construct.  Clay Golems are mobile tanks, but like tanks while they are tough, they are easy to hit.  While Clay Golems are strong in combat they have big weaknesses to sonic and bludgeoning damage that increases as they golem ages and becomes more brittle (master advances in levels).

<Color=Green>Animal familiars are perhaps the most common type of familiar and are generally the easiest to bond and live with.  They can spend time away from their master without problem (excepting possible predators) and feed themselves, plus a lot of them do not cause a stir when entering a town of village (although a panther would get second looks unless in Chult).

Being animals they can benefit from Druid/Ranger spells such as Magic Fang, etc..<Color=White>

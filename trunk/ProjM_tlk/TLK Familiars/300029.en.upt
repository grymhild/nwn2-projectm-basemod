<Color=Green>Ousiders are familiars summoned from the outer or elemental planes.  These familiars agree to be bonded in return for easy access to the material plane and quite often have their own agenda, not always in agreement with that of their "master".  As outsiders they are effected by spells or other effects that affect outsiders such as Banishment or the turn outsider ability of Clerics with the Good or Evil domains.<Color=White>

The homunculus is a construct using an Imp as its inspiration. With similar skills to the pixie and guaranteed loyalty and obedience, it is a good choice for wizards who desire a smallish, loyal familiar with the manual dexterity to help out in the lab.  The famed Red Wizard Safia was the first known to create such a creature and since then it has been emulated by many mages.

After the war with the King of the Shadows word got around about the use of Blade Golems.  A group of wizards combined resources to discover the long lost art of making Blade Golems and that knowledge has now spread.  Any Wizard with the right skills, time, and resources, can put one of these together.  However, it takes a lot more study to upgrade it to be a real engine of power and this is only achieveable by Wizards of great power.  While possessing several immunities all Blade Golems are very vulnerable to electricity based damage.  They are also highly resistant to slashing and piercing attacks.  Unlike other familiars they do not improve gradually as their master levels but increase abilities etc in spurts as the master introduces improvements to the golem.  However, "program" upgrades give the golem progressive improvments with its blade arm weapon.

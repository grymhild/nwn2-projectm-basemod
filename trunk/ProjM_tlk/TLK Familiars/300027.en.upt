<Color=Red><b>Welcome and Introduction</b><Color=White>
Hi, i'm Loki, and i present to you this extended range of familiars for your gaming pleasure.  The familiars are separated into categories to enable easy finding of the one you desire.  Please read the readme associated with this mod to get more details on the different familiars.

One thing to keep in mind is that each type of familiar has its own racial strengths and weaknesses.  eg: Animals such as the panther can benefit from spells such as Magic Fang, while Undead familiars are suceptible to being turned.

PS: Please don't select me, i refuse to be your familiar. 
<Color=Yellow>Actually, you will get this familiar for two levels, and then afterwards be without one... really, please dont bother selecting it<Color=White>

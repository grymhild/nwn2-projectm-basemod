Eyeballs are close cousins to beholders although significantly weaker. Like their cousins, they are capable of casting magic using their eyestalks and have a number of innate spells from Ray of Frost and Prismatic Spray at higher levels and also as they grow they can cast spells like Mage Armour. Eyeballs are usually adopted as familiars by spellcasters of evil alignments.

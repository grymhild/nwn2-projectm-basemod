Imps are sneaky creatures, capable of using poison and magic against their opponents. Small but insidious devils often bound to the service of sorcerers and wizards, imps have a gleeful attraction to pranks, riddles, and bawdy jokes.  Imps also gain the power of regeneration meaning they can survive combat longer.

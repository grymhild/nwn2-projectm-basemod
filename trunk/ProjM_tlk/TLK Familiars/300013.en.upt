Hell hounds are aggressive, fire-breathing canines brought to the Prime Material Plane from the depths of the Abyss. Always a danger to be around, but they are loyal to their masters.

This eerie dog is quick and eventually gains the ability to spew cones of flames from its crimson jaws. It is also an excellent tracker.

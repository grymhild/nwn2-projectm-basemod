Fire mephits can fling bolts of fire. 

Pulled from the elemental planes, mephits are cunning and swift opponents. These small creatures can be quite hard to kill and also quite deadly. While they dwell mainly on the Elemental plane of Fire they are actually creatures of the outer planes and can be quite often found in the more volcanic and hot areas of the outer planes.

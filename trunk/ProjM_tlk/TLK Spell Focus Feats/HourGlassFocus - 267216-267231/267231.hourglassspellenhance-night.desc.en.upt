Type of Feat: General
Prerequisite: Hourglass Spell Focus (Night).
Specifics: A character with this feat is more adept at casting spells at a given time of day, allowing him to exceed any limits or maximums to caster level by 2. If a spell of 3rd level does 1d6 per caster level to a maximum of 10d6, this would change that maximum to 12d6. This would not increase it beyond the amount granted per level but allows such spells to not be as limited in power as the caster gains in levels.
Use: Automatic. This feat might be selected multiple times, but the effects cancel each other and result in no effect at all.

Type of Feat: Class
Specifics: A 10th-level daggerspell shaper can blend spellcasting with a flurry of dagger attacks. When delivering a touch attack spell and wielding daggers, the daggerspell shaper adds each of her dagger's damage (base damage plus any enhance bonus) to the touch spell's damage. This replaces the Daggercast ability by adding both daggers damage instead of the main hand's damage. Supported spells are Cause Light Wounds, Cause Moderate Wounds, Cause Serious Wounds, Harm, and the reserve feat Clap of Thunder. Each dagger's damage is applied separately of the touch spell's affect.
Use: Selected.

Invocation Type: Greater
Spell Level Equivalent: 6

This invocation summons masses of biting and stinging insects. One swarm is summoned for every three class levels. A swarm deals 2d6 points of magical damage per round. A swarm dissipates after three rounds. <i>Tenacious plague</i> does not stack with itself - if the warlock uses this invocation while swarms still exist, the current swarms will be replaced with the new swarms.

A stormsinger's class level stacks with any levels of bard she has for purposes of determining the number of times per day she may use bardic music. Many of the stormsinger's high-level abilities require her bardic music as well. When a stormsinger uses her bardic music ability to create a stormsong effect (see below), it counts as one (or more) uses of her bardic music for the day.

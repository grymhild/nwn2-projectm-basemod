Type of Feat: Class
Prerequisite: Eldritch Disciple level 1.
Specifics: At each level, you gain new spells per day and an increase in caster level (and spells known, if applicable) as if you had also gained a level in a divine or invocation based spellcasting class to which you belonged before adding the prestige class level. You do not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained. If you had more than one spellcasting class before becoming a eldritch disciple, you must decide which class to progress in. Eldritch blast dice are advanced as though taking warlock levels regardless of which spellcasting progression is chosen.
Use: Automatic.

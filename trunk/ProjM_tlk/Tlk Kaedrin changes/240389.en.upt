<i>Through long wear and hours of combat, you have trained your body to believe in its armor. Where others flinch, you confront. When the sword falls, your instincts, born of bruises and rent flesh, present your cuirass, cuisse, helm, or gorget to meet the blade at the perfect angle, causing it to skitter off harmlessly.</i>

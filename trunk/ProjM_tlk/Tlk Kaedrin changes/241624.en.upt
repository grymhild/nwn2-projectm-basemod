Type of Feat: Class
Specifics: A radiant servant who is at least 8th level can create a positive energy burst that deals 1d6 points of damage per class level to all undead creatures within 100 feet of the character. Undead are allowed a Reflex Save (DC 10 + class level) to avoid the half the damage. This uses up a turning attempt.
Use: Selected.

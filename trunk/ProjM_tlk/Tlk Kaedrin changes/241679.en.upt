Type of Feat: Class
Specifics: A ninja is highly trained at dodging blows, and she has a sixth sense that lets her avoid even unanticipated attacks. When unarmored and unencumbered, a ninja adds her Wisdom bonus (if any) to her Armor Class. This ability does not stack with the monk's AC bonus ability and the bonus can not exceed the number of levels you have in the Ninja class. In addition, a ninja gains a +1 bonus (Dodge) to AC at 5th level. This bonus increases by 1 for every five ninja levels thereafter (+2 at 10th, +3 at 15th, +4 at 20th, +5 at 25th, and +6 at 30th).
Use: Automatic.

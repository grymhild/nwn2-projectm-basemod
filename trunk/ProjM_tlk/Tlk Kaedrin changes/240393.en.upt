Type of Feat: General
You send a powerful shot cleaving through your enemies.
Prerequisites: Str 15, Point Blank Shot, BAB +10
Benefit: You can choose to make a single, mighty attack that blasts through multiple opponents with a ranged weapon. This attack requires a standard action, and your shot takes the form of a 60-foot line. Make a seperate attack roll against each creature in the line. If struck, creatures along this line take damage from your shot, though any extra damage (such as from a sneak attack or a flaming weapon) is applied only against the first creature struck.
Special: A fighter can select Penetrating Shot as one of his fighter bonus feats.
Use: Selected.

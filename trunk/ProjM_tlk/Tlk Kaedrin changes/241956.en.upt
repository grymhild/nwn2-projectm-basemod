This spell infuses your body with energy drawn from the Positive Energy Plane, making it easer to repair injuries. Whenever you cast or are the target of a healing spell, you are healed a number of extra points equal to twice the spell's level. If such a spell heals at least 10 points of damage, it also removes the fatigued condition (or reduces exhaustion to fatigue).

Specifics: The barbarian may rage, gaining a +4 morale bonus to Strength and Constitution and +2 to all Will saving throws, in exchange for a -2 penalty to Armor Class. Rage lasts for 3 + (Con modifier after rage bonus) rounds. After the rage effect expires, the barbarian is fatigued and suffers a -2 Strength, -2 Dexterity and a -10% movement penalty for 5 rounds (at level 17, the barbarian gets Tireless Rage and no longer deals with this penalty). At 11th level, the rage ability becomes greater rage, giving the barbarian +6 to Strength and Consitution and +3 to Will saves (the -2 penalty to Armor Class still applies). At 20th level, the rage ability becomes mighty rage. The Strength and Constitution bonuses increase to +8, and the Will save bonus to +4. The AC penalty remains -2.
Use: Selected. The barbarian may use this ability once per day at first level, +1 use per day at level 4, and every 4 levels thereafter.  The feat has a cooldown timer that lasts as long as the length of the rage and fatigue (if any).

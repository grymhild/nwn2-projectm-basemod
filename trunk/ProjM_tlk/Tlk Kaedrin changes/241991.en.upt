<i>You can demoralize an enemy with horrible condemnations and grim portents of impending doom.
Type: Bardic Music
Prerequisite: Bardic Music, Intimidate 8, Perform 8
Benefit: You can spend one of your bardic music uses to utter a string of crass and appalling epithets and curses at one enemy within 120 feet. The intended target must be able to hear you. A target that fails a Will save (DC 10 + your character level + your Cha modifier) is cursed with a -10 penalty to attack rolls, saves, and skill checks for 1 round (plus any other bardsong duration modifiers). This ability is an instant action.
Use: Selected.

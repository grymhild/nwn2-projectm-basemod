Type: General
Prerequisite: Wis 17, Improved Unarmed Strike, Stunning Fist, BAB +10
Benefit: You can make an melee touch attack that deals no damage but has a chance of paralyzing your target. If your attack is successful, your target must attempt a Fortitude saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wis modifier). If the target fails his saving throw, it is paralyzed for 1d4+1 rounds. Each attempt to paralyze an opponent counts as one of your Stunning Fist attacks for the day. Creatures immune to stunning cannot be affected by this feat.
Special: A fighter may select Weakening Touch as one of his fighter bonus feats.

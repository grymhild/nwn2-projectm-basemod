Type of Feat: Class
Specifics: Death Blades imbue their chosen bastard swords, also called "death blades," with negative energy that deals an extra 1d4 points of negative energy damage. This damage increases to a 1d6 at 5th level and to a 1d8 at 9th level. Death blades are usually enchanted with other magical properties as well. As long as the Death Blades main hand is holding a bastard sword, they hands become wreathed in the energy allowing offhand weapons to benefit as well.
Use: Automatic.

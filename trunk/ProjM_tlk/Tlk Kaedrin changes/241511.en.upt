Type of Feat: Class
Specifics: The dissonant chord's ability to counterspell has improved.  Instead of protecting against a single spell, it now lasts a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier, the duration is extended from 10 rounds to 10 rounds plus your Charisma modifier (along with any other song duration modifiers), and the spell resistance granted gains a bonus equal to half your Charisma modifier.
Use: Automatic.

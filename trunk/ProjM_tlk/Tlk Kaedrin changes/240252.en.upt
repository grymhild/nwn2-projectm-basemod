The divine seeker can call upon her deity's power to shield her from prying eyes and ears. As a standard action, she can grant herself a +10 sacred bonus (or profane bonus, if her patron deity is evil) on Hide and Move Silently checks. This benefit lasts for a number of minutes equal to her Charisma modifier (minimum 1 minute). This ability is usable once per day.

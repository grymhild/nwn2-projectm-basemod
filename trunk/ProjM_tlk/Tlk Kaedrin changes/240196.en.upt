Type of Feat: Class
Prerequisite: Shining Blade level 1.
Specifics: On every odd level, the Shining Blade progresses in one selected divine spellcasting class. If a character had more than one spellcasting class in which he could cast divine spells before he became a Shining Blade, the player must decide which class to assign each level of Shining Blade for the purpose of determining spells per day and spells known.
Use: Automatic.

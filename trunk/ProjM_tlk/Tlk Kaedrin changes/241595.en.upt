Type of Feat: Class
Specifics: A dervish can become a whirling dancer of death a certain number of times per day. She gains a bonus on her attack and damage rolls; +1 at 1st level, and it increases by an extra +1 at every odd-numbered level thereafter.

A dervish may only perform a dervish dance while wielding a slashing weapon (she may use multiple weapons only if both weapons are of the slashing type). She cannot perform a dervish dance in any armor heavier than light or if she is using a shield.

A dervish dance lasts 1 round for every 2 ranks of Perform that the character has. At the end of a dervish dance, the character becomes fatigued for 1 minute (unless she is a 9th-level dervish, at which point this limitation no longer applies).

Fatigue causes a -2 penalty to Strength and Dexterity as well as a 10% movement speed reduction.
Use: Selected.

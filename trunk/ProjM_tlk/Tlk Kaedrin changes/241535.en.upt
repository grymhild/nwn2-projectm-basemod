<color=Gold><b>Default Child of Night</b></color>

This is the default package for the Child of Night, modeled on the Wizard default package.  This will be replaced with a custom package when time permits.

This package does not give any special abilities to your character. It simply configures your skills and feats so that you don't have to.

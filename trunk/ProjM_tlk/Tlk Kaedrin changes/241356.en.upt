Type of Feat: Class
Specifics: This ability is granted at level 7. You gain the ability to change your eldritch blast in a wave of healing energy (20' radius, centered on you). The blast heals living creatures instead of dealing damage to them (the damage healed is equal to the damage normally dealt).
Use: Automatic.

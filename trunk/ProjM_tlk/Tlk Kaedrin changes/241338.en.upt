If the caster is wounded, she can cast this spell and touch a living creature. The creaure takes the caster's wounds as damage, either 1 point per caster level or the amount needed to bring the caster up to her maximum hit points, whichever is less. The caster heals that much damage as if a cure spell had been cast on them.

Type of Feat: Class
Specifics: At each level except 2nd, you gain new spells per day and an increase in caster level and spells known as if you had also attained a level in a casting class to which you belonged before adding the prestige class level. You do not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained such as bonus feats. If you had more than one spellcasting class before becoming a child of night, you must decide which class to progress in. This is a 9/10 progression class in either Divine, Arcane, or Invocation magic.
Use: Automatic.

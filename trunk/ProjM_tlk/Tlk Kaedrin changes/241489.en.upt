Type of Feat: Class
Specifics: At 3rd level, a sword dancer causes a ghostly sword (identical to the one in her right hand) to come to life and begin attacking the enemy. It has a BAB equal to the sword dancer's and cannot be killed. The sword remains for four rounds and can be used a number of times per day equal to her class level. This is an instantly activated ability.
Use: Selected.

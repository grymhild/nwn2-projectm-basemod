Type of Feat: Class
Prerequisite: Spirit Shaman 4.
Specifics: A Telthor wolf companion may be summoned (and unsummoned) by the character. An unsummoned companion can be recalled after a short cooldown time. If the companion is killed, it cannot be summoned again until the spirit shaman rests. Note that a spirit shaman's effective level is level - 3 for determining their telthor companion's abilities and hit dice and only Spirit Shaman and Feywild Warden levels count. Natural Bond and Epic Animal Companion can increase your companion's hit dice. Warning: Taking Telthor Companion will prevent any other companion type (such as Dinosaur, Magical Beast, or Dragon) from being used.
Use: Selected.

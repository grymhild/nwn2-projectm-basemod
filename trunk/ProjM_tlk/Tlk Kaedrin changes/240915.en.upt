<color=Gold><b>Star Elf</b></color>

Star elves are the least common sort of elves in Faer√ªn. Also called mithral elves, they have fair skin (sometimes tinged with blue) and hair of silver-white, black, or blue. Their eyes are blue or green, with gold flecks. They are the elven subrace least tolerant of humankind, and few half-elves are descended from star elves.

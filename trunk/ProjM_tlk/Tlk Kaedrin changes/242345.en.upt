Type of Feat: Class
Prerequisite: Bard level 1, Perform 3 ranks
Specifics: Every hostile creature within 90 feet must make a Will save (against a DC of 10 + your Perform skill). This is an enchantment (compulsion) mind-affecting ability. If the target fails this save, then they are dazed for as long as the song is playing and the bard is within 90 feet of them. If a creature is attacked, or is within 10 feet of a creature being attacked, the effect ends for that creature, though anyone who fails their saving throw will be dazed for at least one round. There is a cool down of 10 rounds before this ability can be used again.
Fascinate effects up to one enemy per level of the bard.

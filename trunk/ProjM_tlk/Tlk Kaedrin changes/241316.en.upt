Type of Feat: Class
Prerequisite: Dragonslayer level 1.
Specifics: At each odd level (1, 3, 5, 7, 9), you gain new spells per day and an increase in caster level (and spells known, if applicable) as if you had also gained a level in an arcane, divine, or invocation based spellcasting class to which you belonged before adding the prestige class level. You do not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained. If you had more than one spellcasting class before becoming a dragonslayer, you must decide which class to progress in.
Use: Automatic.

When you play your healing hymn, your allies can cast curative spells more effectively.
Bards at 1st level can choose between Fascinate and Healing Hymn
Benefit: If you have 3 or more ranks of Perform, you can use your music or poetics to create an area conducive to healing. To be affected, an ally must be able to see and hear you perform. The effect lasts x and for 5 rounds thereafter. An affected ally who casts any conjuration (healing) spell gains a +1 bonus on the roll for each base rank you have in the Perform skill. Each use of healing hymn counts as one daily use of your bardic music ability.

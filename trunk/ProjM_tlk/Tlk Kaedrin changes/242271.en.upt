Type of Feat: Background Trait
Prerequisite: Only available at 1st level.
Specifics: For the purpose of determining bonus spells and the saving throw DCs of spells you cast, treat your primary spellcasting ability score (Charisma for bards, sorcerers, and warlocks; Wisdom for divine spellcasters; Intelligence for wizards) as 2 points higher than its actual value. If you have more than one spellcasting class, the bonus applies to all of those classes. Warlocks only gain the bonus to DC and do not gain any extra invocations.
Use: Automatic.

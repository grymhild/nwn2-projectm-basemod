Type of Feat: Class
Prerequisite: Knight of Tierdrial level 1.
Specifics: At every level you gain new spells per day and an increase in caster level (and spells known) as if you had also gained a level in an arcane, divine, or invocation spellcasting class to which you belonged before adding the prestige class level except for the Sorcerer and Wizard. If you had more than one spellcasting class before becoming a Knight of Tierdrial, you must decide which class gains the increased casting ability.
Use: Automatic.

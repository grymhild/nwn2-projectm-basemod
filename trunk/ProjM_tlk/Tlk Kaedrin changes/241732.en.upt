Type of Feat: Class
Specifics: At each silverstar level, the character gains new spells per day (and spells known, if applicable) as if she had also gained a level in a divine spellcasting class she belonged to before adding the prestige class. If a character had more than one spellcasting class before becoming a silverstar, she must decide which class she increases when she gains a level.
Use: Automatic.

Type: General
Prerequisite: Wis 17, Improved Unarmed Strike, Stunning Fist, BAB +2
Benefit: You can make an melee touch attack that deals no damage, but instead applies a -6 penalty to the target's Strength score for 1 minute (no saving throw). Multiple weakening touches delivered on the same target are not cumulative. Each attempt to deliver a weakening touch counts as one of your Stunning Fist attacks for the day. Creatures with immunity to stun effects can not be affected by this feat.
Special: A fighter may select Weakening Touch as one of his fighter bonus feats.

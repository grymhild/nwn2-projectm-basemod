Prerequisite: Arcane trickster level 1.
Specifics: At 1st level, once per day, the arcane trickster can dispel all magical effects on a target and receive statistical bonuses from doing so.  The ability is a touch attack "greater" dispel. Level 10 Arcane Tricksters have an uncapped dispel like Disjunction.  If successful, the effects vanish from the target and the arcane trickster receives +2 bonus to attack rolls and all saving throws for the next ten rounds plus your arcane trickster level.  He can use this ability twice per day at 5th level and three times per day at 9th level.
Use: Selected.

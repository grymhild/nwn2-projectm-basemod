You must succeed on a ranged touch attack with the ray to strike a target. This ray causes the creature it hits to become weak and slow for the spell's duration. A struck creature takes a penalty to Strength equal to 1d6 +1 per two caster levels (maximum 1d6 + 10). In addition, a subject that fails a Will save is slowed.

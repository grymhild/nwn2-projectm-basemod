Type of Feat: Class
Specifics: At 1st, 4th, 7th, and 10th level, a frost mage's body becomes more like the ice he venerates. His skin turns whiter and colder to the touch as the permanent layer of frost grows deeper. This provides an increase to the character's existing natural armor starting at +1 and increasing by +1 each time to +4 at 10th. This is an enhance bonus and does not stack with other Natural AC bonuses.
Use: Automatic.

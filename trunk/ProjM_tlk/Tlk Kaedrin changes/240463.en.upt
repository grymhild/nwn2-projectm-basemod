Type of Feat: Class
Prerequisite: Stormsinger level 1.
Specifics: On every level, the Stormsinger progresses in one selected arcane or divine spellcasting class. If a character had more than one spellcasting class in which she could cast spells before she became a Stormsinger, the player must decide which class to assign each level of Stormsinger for the purpose of determining spells per day and spells known.
Use: Automatic.

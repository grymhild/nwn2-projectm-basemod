Type of Feat: Class
Specifics: At 5th level, a dissonant chord can use her Perform skill to negate magic. This works as Mordenkainen's Disjunctions with a cap equal to her bard level (no prestige classes count and this has a +25 max cap). This potent ability is quite exhausting to use as each time it is activated it uses three of her bardic music uses for the day.
Use: Selected.

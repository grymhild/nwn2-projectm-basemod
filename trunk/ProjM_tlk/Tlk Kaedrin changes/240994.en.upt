Type of Feat: Class
Prerequisite: Shadowbane Stalker level 1.
Specifics: A shadowbane stalker continues training in divine spellcasting as well as learning. At each level gained in the shadowbane stalker class except for 4th and 9th, she gains new spells per day (and spells known) as if she had gained a level in a divine spellcasting class she belonged to before adding the prestige class level. If she had more than one divine spellcasting class before becoming a shadowbane stalker, she must decide which class to progress in.
Use: Automatic.

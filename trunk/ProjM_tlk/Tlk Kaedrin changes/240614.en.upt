This exotic heavy armor consists of reinforced mithral plates, a layer of padding worn under the armor, and a suit of light mithral chain worn between the two. The armor includes gauntlets, metal-shod boots, a heavy helm, and carefully wrought joint guards. As with full plate, buckles and straps distribute the weight over the wearer's body. Though constructed of mithral material, this armor is still considered Heavy armor.

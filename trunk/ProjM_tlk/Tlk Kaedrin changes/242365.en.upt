Type of Feat: Class
Specifics: In combat, a dark companion functions like a floating hex that you place upon your foes. By weakening the defenses of enemies, your dark companion makes your spells and attacks (and those of your allies) more powerful. Any enemy within 20' of you takes a -2 penalty on its saves and to its AC. This penalty stacks with the hexblades curse abilities.
Use: Automatic

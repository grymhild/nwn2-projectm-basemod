Type of Feat: Class
Specifics: At 3rd level, the elemental archer is capable of directing their chosen elemental energy into a protective shield about them once every 5 minutes.  They gain a damage shield of their element that also adds a shield AC bonus. The shield AC bonus is equal to half their class level (+3 at level 5) and the damage shield's damage is d4 + half their class level (d4 + 3 at 5th).  It lasts for a number of rounds equal to their con bonus plus their class level. The elemental archer is able to use this shield more often once they achieve 5th level (every 2 minutes, 30 seconds).
Use: Selected.

<color=Gold><b>Dragonblood</b></color>

If a race possesses the dragonblood subtype, it has a strong affinity to dragonsâ€”which means that spells, effects, powers, and abilities that affect or target dragons also affect it. The subtype qualifies a creature to use magic items normally only usable by dragons, and qualifies the creature to take feats that have the subtype as a prerequisite. The dragonblood subtype also makes creatures subject to harmful effects that affect dragons. 

The following are examples of dragonbloods seen in Faerun.

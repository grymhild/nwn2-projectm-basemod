<color=Gold><b>Orc</b></color>

Orcs are a race of savage humanoids that have been a pest to the civilized cultures of Toril, particularly Faerun for as long as any can remember. Orcs vary in appearance, based on region and subrace, but all share certain physical qualities. Orcs of all kinds usually have grayish skin, coarse hair, stooped postures, low foreheads, and porcine faces that feature lower canines that resemble boar tusks. Many also have wolf-like ears that are pointed on the ends, similar to elves. Orcs are roughly the same size as humans. Orcs breed fast and live short lives compared with most other races. 

There are 4 subraces of orcs in Faerun: the ever-raiding mountain orcs; the spiritual gray orcs; the militaristic deep orcs (also known as orogs); and the ondonti fey orcs.

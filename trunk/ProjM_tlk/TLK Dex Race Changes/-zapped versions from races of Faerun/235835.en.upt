<color=Gold><b>Human</b></color>

Humans in Faerun are widespread, can be found in most regions and, in general, are fierce and disagreeable, which can sometimes lead certain other races to view them with contempt. They are renowned for their diversity and ambition, and although they lack specializations like other races, they can excel in many areas. Humans come in a wide variety of complexions and sizes. Light skin is most common amongst inhabitants of the northern climates and dark skin amongst those of southern regions, but these are hardly absolutes and most falling somewhere in between the two extremes. Human hair is usually black or brown, but may be blond or red as well. Most human eyes are brown, blue, or hazel, though green or gray eyes are also fairly common with some abnormalities like red or violet also heard of.

Humans are short-lived compared to races such as the elves and dwarves whose lives can span many centuries. The average longevity of a healthy adult human is about 75 years, though some venerable members of the race live as long as 90 and some humans, through magical means, have obtained a lifespan that is measured in centuries or even millennia. One of the key features of humanity is their adaptivity, which carries over to both their physical and mental characteristics. The natural human capacity for physical adaptation means humans are a widely varied lot in appearances and also gives them a strong advantage for survival under adverse condiitions.

While to many perhaps unknown, subraces of humans do exist in the corners of Faerun: the Underdark dwelling Deep Imaskari and the snake-blooded Extaminaars are two of them.

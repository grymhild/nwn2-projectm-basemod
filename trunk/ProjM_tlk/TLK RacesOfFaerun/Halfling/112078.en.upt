<color=Gold><b>Halfling</b></color>

Halflings are clever, capable opportunists. Halfling individuals and clans find room for themselves wherever they can. Often they are strangers and wanderers, and others react to them with suspicion or curiosity. Depending on the clan, halflings might be reliable, hard-working (if clannish) citizens, or they might be thieves just waiting for the opportunity to make a big score and disappear in the dead of night. Regardless, halflings are cunning, resourceful survivors. 

There are five races of halflings: the common lightfoot halfling. the homely strongheart halfling, the desert dwelling sandstorm halflings, the rare ghostwise halflings, and the wild jungle halflings.

All subraces of halflings are smaller than most humanoids but exceptionally quick.

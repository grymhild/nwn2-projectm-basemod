<color=Gold><b>Dwarf</b></color>

Dwarves are known for their skill in warfare, their ability to withstand physical and magical punishment, their knowledge of the earth's secrets, their hard work, and their capacity for drinking ale. Their mysterious kingdoms, carved out from the insides of mountains, are renowned for the marvelous treasures that they produce as gifts or for trade.

There are seven dwarven subraces: arctic dwarves, korobokuru, wild dwarves, shield dwarves, gold dwarves, gray dwarves (also known as duergar), and desert dwarves.

Shield dwarves, the most common race of dwarves, are physically stout but rough around the edges, receiving +2 Constitution and -2 Charisma. Gold dwarves lack the poor charisma of shield dwarves but are less agile. Gray dwarves are even less charismatic than shield dwarves, but make up for it with natural talents and spell-like abilities. Arctic dwarvs on the other hand may be small, but they're the strongest dwarves in the Realms and fully immune to cold. Wild dwarves are nearly feral, but also have the highest chance to survive poison and disease. The nearly unknown korobokuru hail from Kara-Tur. The hearty desert dwarves live across the Trackles sea in Maztica.

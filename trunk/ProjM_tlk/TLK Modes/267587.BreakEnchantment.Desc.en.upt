Break enchantment can reverse even an instantaneous effect. For each such effect, you make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level, maximum +15) against a DC of 11 + caster level of the effect. Success means that the creature is free of the spell, curse, or effect.If the effect comes from some permanent magic item break enchantment does not remove the curse from the item, but it does frees the victim from the items effects.

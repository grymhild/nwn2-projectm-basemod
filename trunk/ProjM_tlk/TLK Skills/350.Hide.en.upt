Ability: Dexterity.Requires Training: No.Classes: All.This skill allows a character to hide from enemies.Check: The character must succeed at an opposed test against a searching creature's Spot check. Success means that the character goes undetected.Special: The Hide and Move Silently skills combine into a single Stealth action. Movement in Stealth mode is slower than the normal rate. Wearing armor or using a torch inhibits this ability, but low light can provide a bonus. A character in Stealth mode is harder to spot if standing still, and if his stature is small.Use: Select the Stealth action on the modal bar. Invisible characters automatically enter Stealth mode. Opposed Spot and Listen rolls are made once per round, where applicable.

Creating a trap kit requires a trap kit mold, which can be purchased from many merchants throughout the game, a number of elemental components (see below), and access to a blacksmith's workbench and a Smith's Hammer item. To create a trap, place the trap mold and all elemental components into the workbench's inventory, then use the Smith Hammer item on the workbench.To create a specific type of trap, you need the appropriate elemental components, as follows:Acid Splash Trap: Acid FlaskBlob of Acid Trap: Acid Flask and Tanglefoot BagElectrical Trap: Quartz CrystalFire Trap: Alchemist's FireFrost Trap: ColdstoneGas Trap: Choking PowderHoly Trap: Holy WaterNegative Energy Trap: ObsidianSonic Trap: ThunderstoneSpike Trap: DaggerTangle Trap: Tanglefoot BagIn addition, the power level of the trap is determined by the number of elemental components you use in the crafting of the trap.

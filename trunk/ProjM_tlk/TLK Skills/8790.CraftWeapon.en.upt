Ability: Intelligence.Requires Training: No.Classes: All.The character knows how to create most types of weapons and ammunition from different materials. Using Craft Weapon requires an anvil and a Smith's Hammer item, in addition to the appropriate materials (metal ingots, wooden planks, and/or leather hides) and a mold for the desired weapon. The character places all components, including the mold, in the anvil's inventory, then uses the smith's hammer's special ability on the anvil. If the character has enough ranks in Craft Weapon, the new item is created. The mold for each specific weapon lists which materials a weapon requires. The base skill requirements for crafting weapons are:Simple Melee Weapons: 2 ranksMartial Melee Weapons: 5 ranksExotic Melee Weapons: 8 ranksBows and Arrows: 2ranksCrossbows and Bolts: 5 ranksWeapons can be crafted from basic materials (iron, wood, or leather), or from more exotic components, such as mithral or Shederran wood. Exotic materials increase the skill requirement to craft a weapon, but also provide additional benefits. Iron: No modifierWood: No modifierAlchemical Silver: +5 ranksDuskwood: +5 ranksCold Iron: +5 ranksShederran: +5 ranksDarksteel: +10 ranksMithral: +10 ranksZalantar: +10 ranksAdamantine: +15 ranksNote that in order to create a weapon out of an exotic material, all the materials used to craft that weapon must be of the same type. For example, crafting a longsword requires two metal ingots. In order to create a darksteel longsword, two darksteel ingots must be used. Alloying such exotic materials is beyond even the greatest smiths.Use: Selected.

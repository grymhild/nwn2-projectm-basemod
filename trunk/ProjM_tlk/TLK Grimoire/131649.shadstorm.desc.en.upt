Level: Sor/Wiz 8

Saving Throw: Reflex Half and Fortitude Half
Spell Resistance: Yes
This violent pairing of the energy of the Plane of Shadow and the Negative Material Plane creates a brief but intense storm.
Those within the area of the spread of this spell roll a Fortitude saving throw.  Those who fail this check suffer the catastrophic loss of the caster's level/2 (maximum loss of 12) in both temporary Strength and temporary Constitution points.  A successful save indicates that they lose only half that number of temporary points. Additionally, everyone in the spread must roll a Reflex save or suffer 4d12 + 1/level hp (maximum +25) damage. A successful save halves the damage.

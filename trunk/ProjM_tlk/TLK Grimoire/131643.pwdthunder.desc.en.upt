When uttered, the Power Word, Thunder quickly rises to a tremendous pitch and washes outward as a tangible boom of sound.  All creatures within 60 feet of the caster with 30 or fewer hit points are immediately deafened and dazed, with no saving throw.  Creatures with between 30 and 60 hit points are deafened but not dazed.  Creatures with more than 60 hit points are unaffected.  Power Word, Thunder destroys all magical silence in its area of effect.

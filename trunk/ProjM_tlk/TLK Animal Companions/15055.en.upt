The nearly transparent gelatinous cube travels slowly along dungeon corridors and cave floors, absorbing carrion, creatures, and trash. Inorganic material remains trapped and visible inside the cubeâ€™s body. A typical gelatinous cube is 10 feet on a side and weighs about 15,000 pounds, though much larger specimens are not unknown.

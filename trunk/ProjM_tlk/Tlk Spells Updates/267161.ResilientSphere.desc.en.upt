Resilient SphereEvocation [Force]Level:	Sor/Wiz 4Components:	V, S, MCasting Time:	1 standard actionRange:	ShortEffect:	6 foot diameter sphere, centered around a targetDuration:	1 round per level (D)Saving Throw:	Reflex negatesSpell Resistance:	YesA globe of shimmering force encloses a creature, provided the creature is small enough to fit within the diameter of the sphere. This only affects medium sized creatures. The sphere contains its subject for the spell's duration. The sphere is not subject to damage of any sort except from a rod of cancellation, a rod of negation, a disintegrate spell, or a targeted dispel magic spell. These effects destroy the sphere without harm to the subject ( and the dispel only removes the sphere and not any affects on the subject ). Nothing can pass through the sphere, inside or out, though the subject can breathe normally.The subject may struggle, but the sphere cannot be physically moved either by people outside it or by the struggles of those within.This spell can trap someone who is ethereal or invisible ( if you cannot target the creature you can target the ground ). This spell can be used for defense as well.No spells can be cast inside the sphere that target outside the sphere, but the caster can cast spells on himself. Casting disintegrate will remove the sphere instead. Use of any teleportation spell, flee the scene, dimension door, teleport and the like will allow the caster to escape this effect ( even if the effect of the spell is haste due to server restrictions on teleport ).Player characters targeted by this spell are only affected for a maximum of 5 rounds.Material ComponentA hemispherical piece of clear crystal and a matching hemispherical piece of gum arabic.

You summon one of a variety of aberrations. It is never clear which type of aberration will appear, but it will always be one of these: a Drider Chief, a Beholder, a Mind Flayer Darkener, an Umber Hulk, or a Battle Devourer. The summoned aberration will do your bidding to the best of its abilities, for the duration.

You infect the subject with a compulsive urge that uses up his/her spells for the day. On a failed Will save, the subject then abandons his/her highest-available-level spell. Each round, the subject abandons another spell or spell slot, moving to lower-level spells once the higher-level spells are gone. The subject doesnt realize the spells are gone until he/she attempts to cast them and finds them unavailable. EE

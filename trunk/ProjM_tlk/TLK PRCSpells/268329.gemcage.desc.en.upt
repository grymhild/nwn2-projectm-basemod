You trap the targeted creature in a gem in your possession. The possession of a valuable enough gem determines whether the attempt of entrapment is valid or not. If you possess a gem of required value, then the target creature must make a Will save. If it fails, then the target vanishes and is trapped inside your gem, which you may use at a later time to release the creature once more. If the creature is later released, it will hold the same feelings as before (i.e. The creature will still be hostile if it was at the time of entrapment).

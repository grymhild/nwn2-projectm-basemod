A hellball is a massive blast of energy that detonates with a thunderous roar. It deals 10d6 points of acid damage, 10d6 points of fire damage, 10d6 points of electricity damage, and 10d6 points of sonic damage to all creatures within the area. Unattended objects also take this damage.
A sun-bright, fist-sized globe of strobing energy streaks forth and blossoms into an effect described by the rare survivor as hell on earth.

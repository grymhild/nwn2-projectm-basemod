Culled from the repertoire of a legendary wizard, this epic spell turns all Medium-size or smaller creatures in the area into penguins. The transformed creatures retain their mental faculties, including personality, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, level and class, hit points, alignment, base attack bonus, base save bonuses, extraordinary abilities, and spell-like abilities. They assume the physical characteristics of penguins.

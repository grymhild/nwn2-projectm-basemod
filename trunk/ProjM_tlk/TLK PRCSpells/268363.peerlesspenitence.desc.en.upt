Gods listen. Thus the penitent are rewarded, and the heretics are punished. With a casting of this spell, which is actually a magically aided prayer, you call upon your god to interfere in the course of an ongoing battle or conflict. The more dire the circumstances for you, the greater the aid given to you; the more opposing the beliefs are of the creatures around you, the greater the wrath exacted upon them.

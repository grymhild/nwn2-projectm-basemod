Because magic is powerful, so, too, is the ability to dispel magic. You can use Superb Dispelling to end ongoing spells that have been cast on a creature or object, or to end ongoing spells within an area.
One object, creature, or affected area is the target of the spell. You make a dispel check against the spell currently in effect on the target. A dispel check is 1d20 + 1 per caster level (maximum +40) against a DC of 11 + the spells caster level. If successful, the target's effects are dispelled.

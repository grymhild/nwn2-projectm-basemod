Invocation Type: Greater
Spell Level Equivalent: 6

This invocation summons masses of biting and stinging insects. One swarm is summoned for every three class levels. A swarm has an attack bonus of the casters base attack plus his charisma bonus and it deals 2d6 + Warlock bonus points of magical damage when it hits. A swarm dissipates after three rounds.

The Warlock bonus is the lesser of your charisma modifier or your warlock level / 3.

<i>Tenacious plague</i> does not stack with itself - if the warlock uses this invocation while swarms still exist, the current swarms will be replaced with the new swarms.

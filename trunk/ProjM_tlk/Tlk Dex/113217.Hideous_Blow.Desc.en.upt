Invocation Type: Least; Blast Shape
Spell Level Equivalent: 1

This invocation charges your melee attack with the power of an eldritch blast. If you successfully hit with your melee attack, the target is affected as if struck by your eldritch blast. This damage is in addition to any weapon damage that you deal with your attack, although the eldritch blast effect will trigger even if no damage is caused by the weapon itself. This invocation lasts until you successfully hit with your melee attack.

This spell if it targets an opponent, will make you cast it upon your weapon and then proceed to do a normal melee attack. You can also directly target your weapon in inventory and it will take effect the first time you hit an opponent, within 2 rounds + 1 round per warlock level.

Shadow Hand (Strike)
Level: Swordsage 5, Saint 5
Prerequisite: Two Shadow Hand maneuvers
Initiation Action: 1 standard action
Range: Melee attack
Target: One creature
Saving Throw: Fortitude partial

As part of this maneuver, you make a single melee attack. If this attack hits, your opponent takes 4 points of Constitution damage in addition to your attack's normal damage. A successful Fortitude save (DC 15 + your Wisdom modifier) reduces this Constitution damage to 2 points, although the foe still takes full normal melee damage.

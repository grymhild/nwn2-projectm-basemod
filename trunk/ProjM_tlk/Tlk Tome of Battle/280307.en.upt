Diamond Mind (Strike)
Level: Swordsage 3, Warblade 3
Initiation Action: 1 standard action
Range: Melee attack
Target: One creature

Your mind rather than your physical power allows you to deal grievous injuries to your foes. When you attack, your training and mental focus allow you to score a telling blow. 

As part of this maneuver, make a melee attack. If this attack hits, you do not deal normal damage. Instead, you make a Concentration check and deal damage equal to the check result. Your Strength modifier, your weaponâ€™s magical properties (if any), and any other extra damage you normally deal do not modify this check (including extra damage from class abilities, feats, or spells).

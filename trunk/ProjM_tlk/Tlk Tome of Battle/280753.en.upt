Type of Feat: Class
Prerequisite: Saint level 5, Zen Archery.
Specifics: At 5th level, your continued dedication to ranged weaponry allows you to make extremely complex shots.  Any maneuver that would normally require you to make a to hit roll with a melee weapon, you may now initiate with a ranged weapon.  This excludes attacks made as part of charge, maneuvers that are already ranged, and abilities such as <i>Mighty Throw</i>, which require you to make a touch attack, but it does include maneuvers such as <i>Emerald Razor</i> which allow you to make a touch attack <i>in place of</i> a to hit roll.

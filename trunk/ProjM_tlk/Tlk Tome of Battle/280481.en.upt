Type of Feat: Class
Prerequisite: Swordsage level 2.
Specifics: Starting at 2nd level, you can add your Wisdom modifier as a bonus to Armor Class, so long as you wear light armor, are unencumbered, and do not use a shield. This bonus to AC applies even against touch attacks or when you are flat-footed.  This bonus qualifies as a shield bonus and will not stack with abilities or spells that grant the same bonus.

Use: Automatic.

Iron Heart (Boost)
Level: Warblade 7
Prerequisite: Three Iron Heart maneuvers
Initiation Action: 1 swift action
Range: Personal
Target: You

You swing your weapon in a wide, deadly arc. With your supreme skill and martial training, you aim your attack so that as you strike one opponent, you set yourself up perfectly to make a second attack against a different foe. As your weapon strikes one opponent, it cuts into him, then ricochets to your second target. 

You make an extra melee attack against an enemy you are currently targeting.  If this attack hits you immediately make a free attack at your highest attack bonus against a different enemy that you threaten.  You must be actively engaged in an attack action to initiate this maneuver.

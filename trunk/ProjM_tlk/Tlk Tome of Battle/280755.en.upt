White Raven (Boost)
Level: Crusader 1, Warblade 1
Initiation Action: 1 swift action
Range: 30 ft.
Target: One ally

Your study of the White Raven discipline has taught you that, more than anything else, moral can turn the tide of battle in your favor.  By pointing out to your allies the signs of an opponent's failing stamina and how to exploit them, you can renew their fervor for battle.

When you use this maneuver, select an ally within range.  If your attack bonus is higher than that of your ally, you grant a bonus to their attack rolls, equal to the difference between the two bonuses.  The effect lasts a minimum of one round, up to a number of rounds equal to your Intelligence modifier.  If your attack bonus is equal to or lower than that of your ally, they gain no benefit and the maneuver is expended.

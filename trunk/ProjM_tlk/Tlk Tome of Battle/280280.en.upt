Defensive rebuke allows you to excel at controlling the battlefield around you. Your enemies must pay heed to the threat you pose. If they ignore you in favor of attacking other targets, you take advantage of their lapses with a punishing counterattack.  If your opponent attacks anyone other than you in melee for the duration of the maneuver, that attack provokes an attack of opportunity from you. Enemies you strike become aware of the consequences of the maneuver.

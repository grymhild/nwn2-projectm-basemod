Type of Feat: Class
Prerequisite: Swordsage level 8.
Specifics: As a swordsage, you can focus your training to take advantage of each discipline's fighting style. Each time you gain the discipline focus ability, select one of the six swordsage disciplines to which that focus applies. You can select a different discipline each time you gain discipline focus, but you must know at least one martial maneuver from the selected discipline. Even if you select a different discipline at higher levels, your discipline choice for earlier abilities does not change.

Defensive Stance: At 8th level, you gain a +2 bonus on saving throws whenever you adopt a stance from your chosen discipline.  At 16th level, you can choose a second discipline to which this ability applies.

Use: Automatic.

Type of Feat: Class
With just a short period of meditation, you can change your maneuvers and tactics to meet the threat you currently face.
Prerequisite: Crusader, Saint, Swordsage, or Warblade level 1st.
Specifics: You can change your readied maneuvers at any time by taking a full-round action. If you're a crusader, your current granted maneuvers are lost and you gain new granted maneuvers as if you had just readied your maneuvers for the day.
Normal: You can change maneuvers only when not actively involved in combat.

Use: Select the Martial Adept Menu icon while in combat.

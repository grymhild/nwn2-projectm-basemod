The students of the Stone Dragon discipline model their defenses after the earth itself. The wind might batter the mountain, the river might cut through the plains, but in the end the stone and rock shrug off such assaults. While you are in this stance, you gain a +2 bonus to AC. This stance immediately ends if you move more than
5 feet for any reason.

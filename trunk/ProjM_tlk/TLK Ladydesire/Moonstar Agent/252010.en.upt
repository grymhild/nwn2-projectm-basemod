Moonstar Agents, also known as Teukiir, are members of the Tel Teukiira, a group founded by Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsen when he broke from the Harpers. Similar in many ways to Those Who Harp, Moonstar agents combine a keen understanding of history with a knack for spying on chosen targets andaquiring powerful artifacts. The group recieves the blessings of three deities long favored by the Blackstaff: Mystra, Oghma, and Sehanine Moonbow. In addition, Khelban and his consort, Laeral Silverhand Arunsen, perform arcane rituals reminiscent of elven high magic on members of the group, giving them special magical abilities.

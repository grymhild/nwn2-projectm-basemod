<color=Gold><b>Warmage -- Arcane Archer</b></color>

This package for the warmage is built to give you the proper feats to qualify for the Arcane Archer Prestige class.  You will still likely need to take levels in a class such as Ranger, or Fighter, to qualify for Arcane Archer before 10th level, if you want a full 10 level progression. 

This package does not give any special abilities to your character. It simply configures your skills and feats so that you don't have to.

Epic poems and plays are published regularly, and popularized by noh troupes. The dramas not only dictate fashion in dress, but also in pharses and accents. A popular play can literally change the way Kozakurans greet each other across the country in only a few weeks. Of course, such fads pass quickly, only to be replaced by new ones.

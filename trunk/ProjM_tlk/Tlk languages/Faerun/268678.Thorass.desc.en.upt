ThorassAncient LanguageFamily: Thorass ( a la Italic: Latin, Italian, French )SubGroup: CentralThorassAlphabet: ThorassRegions Spoken: Dead LanguageDificulty: 5Thorass is the precursor to modern common. It uses the common alphabet. It is to Common what Ye Olde Englishe is to the modern tongue. Most people that can understand common can also decipher Thorass, although with some difficulty, given the variable nature of human languages. Thorass is also the name given to the Common alphabet used in Chondathan etc. Thorass is an old human language, the direct ancestor of Common. It was a pidgin variant of Chondathan that western Faerunian traders developed to communicate with their counterparts in other lands. The alphabet of Thorass survives as the alphabet used in Common, Alzhedo, Chessentan, Chondathan, Durpari, Illuskan, Midani (in Anauroch only), Rashemi, Tuigan, Turmic and Uluik.An inscription in Thorass will translate directly into Common, though it will often have a stilted and archaic form of phrasing and vocabulary. Thorass has a base 10 numbering system.

TuiganAlphabet: ThorassRegions Spoken: Hordelands.Dificulty: 1Tuigan is the langauge of the Horde, the nomadic tribes of the endless wastes and the Quoya Desert.Each tribe has it's own dialect, with varying influence based from the old empires of Shou, Raumvira, and Imaskari, all of which conquered the horde lands at their height.There are 15 major tribes, and the Tuigan is the name of just one tribe. The tribes of the Endless Wastes adopted the alphabet of Thorass from traders passing eastwards along the Golden Way to Kara-Tur long ago.Since the defeat of the great Tuigan horde in 1360 DR, small groups of immigrants are starting communities in western lands such as Semphar, Thay, Thesk, Narfell, and Rashemen.

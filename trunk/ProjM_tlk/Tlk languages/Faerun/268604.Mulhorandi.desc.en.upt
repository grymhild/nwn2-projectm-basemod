Other regions where it was  commonly spoken include Murghom, Semphar, and Chessenta.In most areas where Mulhorandi was spoken, it used the Celestial alphabet; however, Thay used the Infernal alphabet instead.Common Mulhorandi surnames included Ankhalab, Anskuld, Fezim, Hahpet, Nathandem, Sepret, and Uuthrakt.The Mulhorandi language came from a language family known as Rauric. Only Mulhorandi and Untheric survived from this linguistic family; Mulhorandi preserved much of the old tongue, while Untheric evolved greatly over the course of the millennia. Mulhorandi was an inflected language with many verb tenses and cases; word order was relatively unimportant. It often sounded thick and slow compared to other languages; some said this was due to the heavy influence of priestly rituals on everyday speech. Basic Mulhorandi writing consisted of complicated pictureglyphs, each of which represented a different idea; it has become somewhat more abstracted over the course of the millenium prior to 1368 DR and consisted of a vocabulary of tens of thousands of pictographs. Most Mulhorandi knew a basic vocabulary of about 3,000 pictographs, while scribes, wizards, and priests learned a more extensive vocabulary.Mulhorandi is rendered in the Celestial alphabet, first introduced by a manifestation of Thoth.

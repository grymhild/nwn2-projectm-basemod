Thorass alphabet.Chessentan was the regional language of the confederation of Chessenta, located in the Old Empires region of southern Faerun. It used the Thorass alphabet.Chessentan was a core language which had two major sublanguages: Akalaic and Chessic. In turn, Akalaic had further sublanguages which included: Arkian, Eshowan, Telfir, Akalan, Akurian, Shaartan and Sespechian. Chessic sublanguages included: Auld Chessic, Alambic, Alambit and Thresk.Typical surnames from this tongue included Aporos, Corynian, Heldeion, Morieth, Nathos, Sphaerideion, and Zora.Chessentans once spoke Untheric, but abandoned that language centuries prior to 1368 DR for the common tongue of the west (using a variation on Untheric writing in their written records, though they reduced the runes to an alphabetical writing scheme). Untheric was often known as a second language, if only to understand ancient writing.In Chessenta and the Wizards' Reach, Chessentan, a tongue closely related to Untheric with strong Chondathan and Shaaran influences, has largely supplanted Untheric. The folk of Chessenta have long used the Thorass alphabet in addition to Dethek runes, and Chessenthan is almost exclusively written using Thorass characters. Both They and the cult of Set render Mulhorandi in the Infernal alphabet, consciously repudiating the rule of the current god-kings.

Other places where it was commonly spoken among humans included Aglarond, Altumbel, the Anauroch, Cormyr, the Dalelands, the Dragon Coast, the Great Dale, the Great Glacier, the Hordelands, Impiltur, the Moonsea, Narfell, Rashemen, the Ride, Sembia, among the Shadovar, Thay, Thesk, Vaasa, the Vast, and the Vilhon Reach. It was also sometimes spoken among dwarves, elves, goblins, half-elves, orcs, half-orcs, planetouched, taers, and volodni.Speakers of the Damaran tongue used the Dethek alphabet of the dwarves.Damaran was a sublanguage of Chard which in turn was a sublanguage of Ulou (Ulou was a precursor language to Netherese). Damaran was in the same family language as Easting.Common Damaran human surnames included Bersk, Chernin, Dotsk, Kulenov, Marsk, Nemetsk, Shemov, and Starag.Most Damarans speak Common and Damaran, two closely related tongues. Damaran employs an alphabet of Dethek runes, a legacy of early cooperation between the inhabitants of Impiltur and the dwarves of the Earthfast Mountains. The exceptions are the inhabitants of Aglarond and Altumbel, who speak Common and Aglarondan, a tongue closely related to Damaran that incorporates many Elven words and uses the elven script of Espruar.Common second languages in Impiltur include Chondathan, Dwarven, Aglarondan, or Chessentan. In Damara and Vaasa, second languages frequently known include Chondathan, Dwarven, Orcish, or Uluik. Many Nars can speak Rashemi or Uluik, and Tuigan is becoming increasingly popular. The inhabitants of the Great Dale are most likely to learn Rashemi, although some learn the Thayan dialect of Mulhorandi In southern Theak, Aglarondan is the most popular second language, while Chondathan and Turmic are the preferred second tongues along the coast around Telflamm. In Aglarond, most inhabitants also speak Elven. Other common second languages include Damaran, Chessentan, Sylvan, or Mulhorandi.All Damaran characters are literate except for barbarians, commoners, and warriors.

Dethek alphabet.Old-Orc is a dead language. No original native textual samples of it are known to exist, but there are scholarly documents that make reference to its existence (see Appendix D). Sometime before the sundering of the drow, orcs, goblins, and hobgoblins shared a single language based on the Elven tongue. At some point in their history, they altogether abandoned the language and switched over to a new one based on the Dwarven Alphabet. There are a few remnants of the Elven language that have managed to survive the transition, generally in the form of antiquated expressions that convert clumsily over to Dwarven in written form, but share a similar meaning to the original Elven. Whatever event caused the orcs and goblinoids to entirely abandon their original language and adopt a new one can only be guessed at, but some believe the great battle in which Gruumsh, the gods of orcs, lost an eye to Corellon Larethian, the Creator of the Elves, may have served as the trigger. Had the sundering of the drow already occurred by this point, it is possible that orcs or goblins would have selected Undercommon as a preferred language, but that is purely conjecture.Old-Orc was eventually discarded in favor of a language based more closely on Dwarven, which then further evolved along two separate lines, resulting in the modern tongues of Goblin and Orc.

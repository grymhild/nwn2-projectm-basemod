SerusanTrade LanguageAlphabet: EspruarRegions Spoken: Inner Sea.Dificulty: 1Serusan is the aquatic equivalent of Common, and is spoken by most aquatic creatures. Uses the Aquan alphabet. Spoken by the sea elves. Espruar alphabet.D'Nesti (Aquatic)Though some aquatic elves spend most of their time high and dry, most inhabit the depths and shallows of the waters. As the spoken tongue does not carry well underwater, the aquatic elves have developed a language combining body motion with sounds derived from Regal Elfin, its parent tongue, to convey meaning.Where a dry elf would say something like "I am going to the house", an aquatic elf would say his name while making gestures to indication movement and then house. Because of this non-verbal streamlining, aquatic elves sometimes have difficulty expressing themselves to their cousins.

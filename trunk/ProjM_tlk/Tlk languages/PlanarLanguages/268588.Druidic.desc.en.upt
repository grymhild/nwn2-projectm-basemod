It was developed by a sect of druids dedicated to Silvanus. Later by agreement amoung the various nature deities this language was shared regardless of faith, and now is almost universally used by the various druid circles.There are numerous dialects, which diverge to some degree but all can understand each other clearly.The druids of the Moonshaes who worship the Earth mother use the dialect called Daelic.There is no written form to this language, it is solely spoken by druids and kept as a secret language.

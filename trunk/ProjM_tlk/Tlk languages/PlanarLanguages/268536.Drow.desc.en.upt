DrowAlso known as: TakanestiFamily: ElvishSubGroup: ShadowAlphabet: EspruarRegions Spoken: The Underdark and in Drow CommunitiesDificulty: 3This is a language of the Drow of the underdark, and after being introduced by the Drow quickly became well known by all the creatures that live below, forming the basis of shadow common. It is based on Elvish and uses the Espruar alphabet.The dark elves have made many changes to elvish, and in many ways it has turned as dark as their speakers have, corrupting and perverting it. Lolth herself it is said has influenced it greatly, and it has clear influences by Abyssek and Infernal in it's wording. It is one of the ways the Drow keep their secrets from prying ears prior to being forced underground.Once the drow settled the underdark they quickly found themselves one of the most advanced races, and quickly sought to dominate any other race they found. The other races did not learn drow to trade with them, but rather to learn as much as they could about them. Being such an advanced language, the various races adopted it wholesale, and speak a derivative called shadow toungue, or undercommon.The Illithid of the underdark all know drow and undercommon for the most part, and while they don't need a language since they can communicate directly via psionics, they generally use Drow when they must speak.

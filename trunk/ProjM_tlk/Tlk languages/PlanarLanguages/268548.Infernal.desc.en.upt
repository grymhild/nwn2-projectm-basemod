InfernalAlphabet: InfernalRegions Spoken: Dificulty: 5Infernal is a language of lies, spoken by creatures who pride themselves on keeping their word, but at the same time taking delight in twisting the meanings of those words to their advantage. It is derived from both the Logos language and Abyssek. It is the langauge of the Nine hells, but it also spoken by many creatures that aspire to increase their own power regardless of the cost.The language is very concise and requires much precision in speaking it, with numerous homophones leading to much confusion as these similar sounding words can vary widely in meaning. Unlike Logos it is based which is a legal language designed to prevent confusion, infernal is designed to ensure there is always something hidden in the fine print. It is used in the bueracracy of hell to ensure things run smoothly, as well as in the numerous pacts signed to ensure hell has access to new souls.This complexity of meaning allows them to be brutally honest and follow the letter of what they said, while at the same time allowing them to make those hearing them think something completely different. This makes it almost impossible to use magic to detect lies while a devil speaks this, as they can just ensure they are speaking literal truth while spinning things to make it appear the opposite. They generally are the only ones who know what they mean, but then the choice of what is meant is reserved for the more powerful creature.It uses the Infernal alphabet which is derived from Logos.It's lineage going back to Abyssek is contested by most devils, as they correctly point out that the other language uses the infernal alphabet. However studying the etymology of wording clearly shows that Abyssek came first, and it's likely that demon kind just never had the patience for writing, which was needed to keep hell organized. Of course of all things the truth is really not important to devils, and there are numerous edicts, laws stating infernal is the first language, and devil kind has been known to hunt down sages to state otherwise.

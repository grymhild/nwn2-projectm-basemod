LogosAlso Known As: ModronPrimordial LanguageAlphabet: DraconicRegions Spoken:  MechanusDificulty: 7The primordial language of law, of order and the celestial beuracracy of mechanus. This was a complex language of thousands and thousands of words, with symbols for each idea or concept or creature, and a rigid complex grammar. These symbols gradually were refined and organized, and ended up with a heavy influence from Aragrakh's draconic script.Logos is a language of logic and reason, with each word being a discrete "logo" symbolizing the given word. It was first a written language of pictograms, very similar to Hieroglyphics, used to record early contracts and agreements.This is a language first shaped by the sheer enourmity of the task of trying to organize the multitude who lives on mechanus. It is used to clearly communicate what is expected of each individual, as well as documenting everything that happens to allow for later review, and to evaluate how things are done for maximum efficiency. It also ensures the laws and edicts put down by the leaders in this realm are clearly understood when sent by courier to distant parts of the plane.As a language of law, it is used by the various courts to preserve the precedents of previous decisions. It also preserves the history of what has come before. As such it is a language which is designed to deal with facts and ethics, and at the same time ensure two parties can come to an agreement and clearly understand what that agreement really means. It also is very good for organizing things, and talking about mathematics.The modrons actively manage this language, with a committee tasked to address issues of ambiguity, or deviation of meaning, or just to remove words which are redundant. An example of redundancy is antonymns, which are purged from the language. An example of this could be the antonyms law and chaos, the modrons would remove one and use the terms law and un-law instead. ( and of course they are capable of un-defining chaos in this way ) Additional affixes are used to show intensity. Likewise Homonyms and Synonyms are removed, the first due to ambiguity, the second due to redundancy.One result of this is that it is very easy to predict what someone is going to say using this language, unlike other languages where there is more than one way to express an idea, by removing redundant words there is only one possible way to express a given idea. But then this is a language spoken by creatures that prefer things to be predictable.The orient of Kara Tur followed the celestial bueuracracy and it's court language of Logos, which developed in Han from which Shou and a multitude of languages derived in their realm.The Celestial and Infernal tongues are based on Logos.

ElvenOther Names: EspruarFamily: ElvishSubGroup: ElvishAlphabet: EspruarRegions Spoken: Elvish Communities ( Except Drow )Dificulty: 3The language of the ancient Elven race, a language which came from the fey realm at the dawn of time. This language is spoken by all surface elves and can be said to be the oldest still spoken ancient language.The current primary language of feywilde is not from elvish derived, but is in fact a sister language and both come from the same primordial fey tongue. How each evolved is very much a description of each group of speakers, the capricious and flighty fey tended focus on the moment and either forgot or changed their language for convenience, often for paltry reasons such as trying to make sure things rhyme.The elves in contrast had a deep respect for history and literature, and developed a writing system very early on, which is now one of the main writing systems in use on the planes, and the first method or writing developed by any fey. They also had many writers and poets who over the years made the language much more sophisticated long before the elves split into various subraces. Many sages actually think ancient elvish is to a large degree the original sylvan, but this could be mainly because prior to their developing writing nothing could be recorded.As an ancient language, and for a race which has split into many very different subraces, elvish has remarkably changed very little and beyond extreme accents all surface elves speaking elvish can easily understand each other, but each has a different name and has words important in each region. Note that the elves of the underdark and under the sea speak distinct languages.Dialects in use on faerun are as follows:Regal Elven: The dialect of the Elfin Court and the dialect used most often between elves of differing clans or tribes, but also the main language of Evermeet. It tends to be quite formal, though not cumbersome. This language combines the best aspects of the elfin dialects into a smoothly flowing, easily recognized language.Elvish Common: This is more a language of convenience and trade, with some words derived from common and used in trading with other races besides elves. Most non elves learning elvish actually are learning this, even though it has many similarities to Silvanesti, Qualinesti, Lyranesti and Cudynesti. Compared to full elvish this is more of a uneducated form which most elves see as speaking slowly so other races can understand them, and they see this as lacking the grace and beauty of well spoken elvish.Silvanesti: South High ForestQualinesti: High Elves - North High ForestKagonesti: Wild and Wood elves of Aglarond and the southwest Elven Court.Dargonesti: Around Great Sea, Shining SeaDimernesti: Sea of Fallen StarsLyranesti: Moon elves East Elven Court and the High ForestCudynesti: Gold elves Principally in Evermeet, trace settlements in Rawlinswood.The written form of elvish is generally called Espruar, which generally are recorded using Silver Runes known for their beauty and elegance. The written alphabet is one of the core writing systems of the planes used by many derivative languages.While most of the elvish races share the same basic language, the drow of the underdark along with the influence of lolth sought to change the language to better preserve their secrets from the surface elves. This resulting language has spread all across the underdark, and is known as undercommon or shadow common. The drow speak their own variant, as do the illithid but almost all creatures of the underdark can understand each other, while surface elves can only understand a word or two. Generally the main things that both drow and surface elves tend to understand well are the insults they throw at each other.Serusan is the language of the Sea Elves and much like how drow has become the common of the underdark, this language is the common tongue of trade under the seas. It is based both on Elvish and Aquan ( which is itself derived from ancient elvish ) and is most likely an adaptation to the much different underwater environment. the sea elves found that water itself changes how words sound enough to makeSeldruin is a separate language closely related to elvish, which is the language of high elven magic. It is in many ways less a derivative language and more of what elvish is derived from, and within it remain many remnants from the primordial language of creation, and it also shares much in common with ancient Aragrakh, the primordial language of the dragons. It is mostly a written language, only spoken aloud in the middle of magical rituals which have not been practiced since the fall of Myth Drannor.Another language derived from elvish is Old Orc, a language long dead and having no relationship to current orcish.
